Rent or buy a crab ring and try your luck; the payoff will be a fresh crab feast you’ll always remember. And you’ll keep coming back for more. \n\nHere are a few tips we want to share from the {{ link url=\"https://myodfw.com/articles/how-crab\" }}Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife{{ /link }}. Be sure to read their instructional flyer How to Crab for important details.\n\nMake sure you have your shellfish license (14 and older requires a shellfish license), crab measuring tool, pots or rings, cooler, gloves, bait holders and bait supply. 3-day licenses are available at local ODFW offices and at many sporting goods or hardware stores.\nSlack water (the time around high or low tide) are the best times to crab. During slack water, crabs are generally walking around and foraging since they are not getting pushed around by tidal exchange.\nCheck all lines on crab pots or rings for kinks or knots to ensure they are durable and will allow gear to work correctly.\nFresh bait is best. Many different types of bait are used for crabbing: turkey, chicken, mink, fish carcass, shad, herring, clams, etc.\nTie the end of your crab line to the dock or pier from where you are crabbing. Throw your crab pot or ring in the water and start crabbing.\nCheck with the {{ link url=\"https://myodfw.com/crabbing-clamming\" }}Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife{{ /link }}website for the most current shellfish regulations and harvest notices.\n\nRental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores often rent and sell rings. Here’s a short list of some locations:\n\nBasin Tackle Shop\\\n63510 Kingfisher Road, Charleston, OR 97420\\\n(541) 888-FISH\\\nOpen Mon-Sat 8am-5pm; Sun 8am-Noon\\\n{{ link url=\"http://www.basintackle.com\" }}www.basintackle.com{{ /link }}\n\nCrab Shack\\\n63840 Crossline Road, Charleston, OR 97420\\\n(541) 888-3433\\\nOpen daily from 8am-6pm\n\nDavey Jones Locker\\\nCape Arago Highway & Boat Basin Road\\\nCharleston, OR 97420\\\n(541) 888-3941\n\n Clamming on Oregon's Adventure Coast\n\n{{ floatimage src=\"/img/crabbing-and-clamming.jpg\" float=\"right\" alt=\"Girl Clamming in \" size=\"100\" }}\n\nIf you’ve been anywhere along the Oregon Coast, you’ve probably heard a lot about clamming; but you might be wondering why it’s so popular among natives and visitors. Clamming is appealing to many Oregonians and visitors because it is relatively easy and the reward is a tasty treat best served in chowder, steamed or fried. There are no special skills required, no expensive equipment, and beginners can usually pick it up quite easily.\n\nThe low tides commonly found from Empire to Charleston make our region one of the top destinations for clam digging. Local bait & tackle shops are usually the best resource for first (and second, third, fourth) time clammers and can usually advise on conditions, regulations, equipment, etc. Some businesses, like {{ link url=\"http://www.basintackle.com\" }}Basin Tackle{{ /link }} on Kingfisher Rd in Charleston, even offer classes on how to use a clam pump and clean the clams (they even share secret recipes!\n\nReady to give it a shot?  Here are some more tips for first-time clammers:\n\n1. Get your shellfish license.\n\np class=\"bullet-para-indent\"Clams can be harvested all year on our coast, but ODFW does require a license.  {{ link url=\"https://myodfw.com/crabbing-clamming/licensing-info\" }}Click here to get your license{{ /link }}./p\n\n2. Wear waterproof boots (trust us).\n\np class=\"bullet-para-indent\"Just take a look at the photos and you will see the necessity of waterproof boots. Otherwise, you may loose or ruin your shoes!/p\n\n3. Dress in layers!\n\np class=\"bullet-para-indent\"Doesn’t matter what season it is, it can get chilly out there! Dress in layers that can get dirty./p\n\n4. Go to a bait and tackle shop before you head out.\n\np class=\"bullet-para-indent\"Some of the best advice you will receive will probably come from one of the fishing experts at one of our\\ local bait and tackle stores. They can tell you when the best time of day to dig would be based on the tides. They can also help you make sure you have the right equipment- a bucket, a shovel (can be rented or borrowed) and/or a tube a.k.a. a “clam gun”./p\n\n5. Keep track of how many clams you dig.\n\np class=\"bullet-para-indent\"You are allowed 20 bay clams per day in the aggregate, however, only 12 of which may be Gaper or Empire clams; again this is something someone at a local bait and tackle shop can help you with.

Our friends at the Front Street Community Bike Works have put together a wonderful resource of cycling trail maps from no hills to dare devil! Click here for the City Bike Riding Trails Map (PDF). \n\ndiv class=\"margin-50px-top\"/div\n\n The Oregon Coast Bike Route\n\nCheck out The Oregon Coast Bike Route (PDF). Oregon has been supporting bicycling since 1971 by developing bikeways throughout the state. Thousands of bicyclists enjoy the natural beauty of the Oregon Coast Bike Route annually. For the most part, it follows US Highway 101 as a shoulder bikeway. In several areas, the route departs from the main highway and follows county roads and city streets. These sections are closer to the ocean, are more scenic, and have lower traffic volumes and slower traffic speeds. Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston is one of the areas where cyclists depart from the main highway and takes a scenic detour along the rugged coastline on Cape Arago Loop and 7 Devils Road. Click here for the North Bend to Bandon Oregon Coast Trail Map.\n\ndiv class=\"margin-50px-top\"/div\n\nWhiskey Run Mountain Biking Trail\n\nCheck out the Whiskey Run Mountain Biking Trails here. The Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trails is a brand new, one-of-a-kind trail system on the Southern Oregon Coast. Ribbons of clay dirt flow and wind through the Coos County Forest in these cross-country style trails. Moderate climbing and fun descending make this system worth the drive to the gorgeous Southern Oregon Coast. The trail system is located about 10 minutes from Bandon or Coos Bay off Highway 101, in the mists of the coastal forest.\n\nLocated in an active logging forest, Whiskey Run gives visitors a view of the Coos County Forest most do not get to see - harvesting in this coastal forest while enjoying sweeping views, tranquil streams, and fern covered forest floors. The trails are a blend between flow and cross country style, and are great for all levels of riders with open sight lines, easy climbs, and chances to catch some air if you want. You'll dip and wind through the forest in this unique South Coast environment.\n\nThese professionally built trails are made to withstand the coast's weather, so when the weather is unfavorable in the Cascades and you want to ride some loam and clay, come on down to the coast. However, please don't ride if the trails are muddy. Check trail reports or call the local shops or guide services. Note: 10 of the 30 miles are complete with Phase II construction set to begin soon.\n\niframe width=\"695\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA0X_rpH930?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\nbrbr\ndiv class=\"margin-50px-top\"/div\n\n Other Mountain Biking Trails\n\nBLUE RIDGE LOOP - is a multi-use trail system that gets some motorcycle traffic. It is a scenic area to ride, though despite it's elevation, views of lower areas are limited to non-existent. Given the different roads throughout the area, there are multiple ride options.\n\nWINCHESTER NORTH - are used primarily by mountain bikers and motorcycles. The trails challenge even the best of riders. There are lots of ruts, roots, steep terrain, and other obstacles on the 17 miles of winding single track.\n\nEMPIRE LAKES - provides a more leisurely trail for biking but it is no less scenic. The trail system, 4 miles paved and 1.5 miles dirt track, is in John Topits Park, centered on the natural beauty of two lakes and stabilized dunes within the park.\n\nEUPHORIA RIDGE TRAILS - this 10 mile track begins on dirt road and quickly moves to single-track trails, through meadows, forest land, and tribal lands.\n\ndiv class=\"margin-50px-top\"/div\n\nFat Biking\n\nFrom rocky headlands to wide-open shores, agates, seabirds, tide pools and lighthouses in the distance, the Oregon Coast is a balm for the soul. Why ride it? Because its 363 miles of glorious coastline are full of wonder, largely car-free and accessible for us all.  - Jen Anderson, Travel Oregon\n\nGrab your big, balloon tires and bring your bike down to the beaches and the dunes. Ride along the miles of Horsfall Beach and into The Dunes for a challenging experience. As Katy Bryce put it in her article, Fat Biking 100 Miles of Oregon Coast, \"Riding fat bikes is not just beach cruising! The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area provided us with the opportunity to shred hard in soft sand. Hike up. Slide down. Giggle. Repeat.\"\n\nWherever you go fat biking on Oregon's Adventure Coast, check the tides and try to go during low tide as much as possible. Beware of sneaker waves and stay off rocks and small, enclosed beaches. Respect the sensitive micro-environments, whether it’s birds or anenome you encounter.",

The cemetery was established in 1915 when the Marshfield Pioneer Cemetery ran out of room. Several graves were moved from the Marshfield Pioneer Cemetery and re-interred in the Sunset Memorial Park for various reasons.\n\nThe southeast corner of the cemetery is dominated by very impressive upright headstones,  several of which are older than the establishment of the cemetery. It is a common practice here to memorialize loved ones with a photo of person buried there. In the Pioneer section of the cemetery, there are three such headstone found where the photo is printed on porcelain.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66409\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-66409 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8328509orig-674x333.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery\" width=\"674\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8328509orig-674x333.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8328509orig-200x99.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8328509orig.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Photo by Steven Michael Photography\n  /p\n/div\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66410\" style=\"width: 543px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-66410 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6134333orig.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6134333orig.jpg 533w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6134333orig-80x120.jpg 80w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6134333orig-89x133.jpg 89w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Photo by Steven Michael Photography\n  /p\n/div\n\nIf only a headstone could talk, what would it say? Several headstones &#8220;do talk&#8221; in the form of an epitaph or inscription. Some epitaph are long, while others are short and to the point like this one found on a very elaborate headstone belonging to Mary A. Stambone who died in 1918. The epitaph reads, &#8220;May She Rest In Peace&#8221;\n\nOr this simple stone that reads, &#8220;At Rest&#8221;\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66412\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-66412 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1975784orig-674x449.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery\" width=\"674\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1975784orig-674x449.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1975784orig-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1975784orig-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1975784orig-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1975784orig.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Photo by Steven Michael Photography\n  /p\n/div\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne of Coos County&#8217;s most famous residents is put to rest here in Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery. His name was Steve Prefontaine, known as &#8220;Pre&#8221;. Steve was an American middle and long-distance runner who competed in the 1972 Olympics. He was a champion runner who held the American record in seven different distance track events.\n\nOn May 30th, 1975, at the age of 24, Steve tragically died in a single car wreck when he ran his car into a rock wall. His car flipped over and he was not wearing a seat belt. Steve&#8217;s blood alcohol level was .16 percent, .6 higher than Oregon&#8217;s legal blood alcohol limit. As a result, the cause of death was determined to be alcohol-related. An unfortunate, tragic death taking a life far to soon. Steve Prefontaine&#8217;s headstone is the only upright headstone in the section in which he is buried at Sunset Memorial Park. His grave is visited by thousands each year.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66413\" style=\"width: 543px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-66413 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4436840orig.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset Memorial Park Cemetery Steve Prefontaine\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4436840orig.jpg 533w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4436840orig-80x120.jpg 80w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4436840orig-89x133.jpg 89w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Photo by Steven Michael Photography\n  /p\n/div\n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday, the Sunset Memorial Park is mostly a &#8220;lawn&#8221; cemetery, with a few exceptions. A lawn cemetery when the headstone lay flat, and make it easier for lawn mowing and maintenance.

After graduating with a degree medical practice, He returned to Coos Bay in January 1893 and served as a doctor there for the next 64 years. He was one of the genuine old-time pioneer doctors, delivering over 1000 babies. He was on-call day and night and traveled on horseback, by boat or on foot, lantern in hand.\n  \nDr. William married Lydia Eliza Yoakam on April 7, 1896 in a ceremony officiated by his father. The Yoakam family is also buried in this cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery has a great mix of different styles of headstones ranging from the large granite cross, belonging to the Horsfall family, to the well preserved decorative headstone throughout. You&#8217;ll find several &#8220;lawn&#8221; style headstones, a few small statues and even a couple of delicate and rarely seen wooden headstones in Coos County.\n\nEven though the Coos River Pioneer Cemetery is still used today, the forces of nature have not been so kind to it resting inhabitants. Ground settling has been a huge problem in some sections of the cemetery. Headstones are tilting left and right, and eventually, gravity will win. There is also a huge infestation of non-native European Ivy that keeps encroaching into the cemetery. Unless measures are taken to preserve such a historic site, nature will win.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66417\" style=\"width: 543px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-66417 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5163978orig.jpg\" alt=\"Coos River &quot;Pioneer&quot; Cemetery\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5163978orig.jpg 533w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5163978orig-80x120.jpg 80w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5163978orig-89x133.jpg 89w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Photo by Steven Michael Photography\n  /p\n/div\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Coos River Pioneer Cemetery is great to visit on warm sunny days.

        "content": "Thanks to Daylight Savings Time, Oregon Coast residents and visitors get an extra hour of low tides during daylight which is great for clamming! The South Oregon coast, home to numerous bays, is the ideal destination for recreational diggers and we expect tides to be ideal for clamming well into spring, summer and even fall!\n\n&#8220;Clamming is a glorious adventure with delicious results,&#8221; says Seattle-based food and travel writer, Melissa A. Trainer a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/index.ssf/2011/05/tothecoastinsearchofclam.html\" target=\"_blank\"in this article for The Oregonian/a. &#8220;And when it comes to eating local, it doesn&#8217;t get any better.&#8221;\n\nIf West Coast clamming is one of the experiences on your bucket list, this is the place and now is the time to do it. The low tides commonly found from Empire to Charleston make our region one of the top destinations for clam digging. Oregon&#8217;s south coast has a particularly diverse selection of clam species found around the bay including gaper, cockle, littleneck, softshell and butter.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66501\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-66501 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/151046010152368607586692544058930809375513n.jpg\" alt=\"Clamming Oregon Coast\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/151046010152368607586692544058930809375513n.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/151046010152368607586692544058930809375513_n-133x133.jpg 133w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Travel Oregon&#8217;s Sarah Tomlin shared this picture of her clamming adventure during a recent visit to Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston.\n  /p\n/div\n\nThink you are up for this culinary adventure? Here&#8217;s what you need to know-\n\nYou&8217;ll need a shellfish license.\n\nClams can be harvested all year on our coast, but ODFW does require a license which ranges from $7-$20.50. a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/licensesregs/shellfish.asp\" target=\"blank\"Click here/a to get your license.\n\nGo to a bait and tackle shop before you head out.\n\nSome of the best advice you will receive will probably come from one of the fishing experts at one of our a href=\"/travelers-guide/fishing-license-requirements/baitshops\" target=\"_blank\"local bait and tackle stores/a. They can tell you when the best time of day to dig would be based on the tides. They can also help you make sure you have the right equipment- a bucket, a shovel (can be rented or borrowed) and/or a tube a.k.a. a &#8220;clam gun&#8221;.\n\nWear waterproof boots and dress in layers\n\nClamming is messy- it&8217;s just part of the fun. You will get dirty and that&#8217;s ok. Waterproof high boots are ideal (usually can be found in Walmart or any sports store). And every Oregonian knows the weather can change in a matter of moments, here- so it&#8217;s better to dress in layers.\n\nWatch these tutorials and learn from the pros!\n\nWatch this video to learn the basics of digging:\n  \n\nRob of Basin Tackle in Charleston, OR demonstrates how to clean once you&8217;ve caught them:\n  \n\nFor details, changes and more information, we encourage you to check directly with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.

He’s Rob, the owner, and he’s a wealth of information for visitors like us. My wife and I walk past him on our way to buy some shellfish licenses. An empty shell glistens on the asphalt at his feet.\n\n“Some people use gloves when they’re digging for clams but I don’t,” he explains to a visitor who, judging by his shiny muck boots, is about to go clamming. “I like to feel the clam, get my fingers down around him and work him out,” we overhear him say. “Do it all with your shovel and you’ll just break the poor guy.”\n\nimg class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-66691\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Digging-for-Clams-in-Coos-Bay-674x446.jpg\" alt=\"Digging for Clams in Coos Bay\" width=\"520\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Digging-for-Clams-in-Coos-Bay-674x446.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Digging-for-Clams-in-Coos-Bay-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Digging-for-Clams-in-Coos-Bay-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Digging-for-Clams-in-Coos-Bay-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Digging-for-Clams-in-Coos-Bay.jpg 808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" /\n\nWatch Rob demonstrate how to clean the clams once you&8217;ve caught them:\n  \n\nKicking back in Coos Bay\n\nMy wife and I have come to Coos Bay on the southern Oregon coast to try our hands at clamming, too. We’ve been happily married for nearly a decade and yet we can count on a bivalve the number of real vacations we’ve taken together. Work, kids and an unruly yard:\n\nLife and its flotsam now fill the calendar for months in advance. For us, the hardest part of a vacation has always been committing to take one, so when a friend offered to watch our kids we darted off to Coos Bay, just the two of us. We rolled over the moody Coast Mountains and along towering dunes. We passed a herd of elk and more and more seafood joints until the briny tang of Oregon’s largest bay filled the car.\n\nCoos Bay, which is really three communities—Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston— has always stood out for its real-town feel. Fishermen with ropes for arms all knotted with muscle swig sweaty pints at places like the Portside while you can smell the freshly chopped wood chips from the mills down by a href=\"/listings/the-mill-casino/\" target=\"blank\"The Mill Casino Hotel/a, a casino with the best rooms in town. There’s an a href=\"/listings/historic-egyptian-theatre/\" target=\"blank\"Egyptian theater/a from 1925 with a grand balcony and an original Wurlitzer on South Broadway, where beer and movie nights bring out the crowds. People move about with the same what-me-worry flow as the easy rhythm of the tides.\n\n Clamming\n\nAnd that’s really why we’re here. If the world is an oyster, then Coos Bay is its clam and it all hinges on the tides. Catch Coos on a good “low-low” tide and the mud flats will extend for miles in every direction. There are public spots like Empire, Pigeon Point, and Point Adams where you can dig deep for gapers and rake up the littlenecks. There are cockles, purple varnish clams and softshells, too. No other place on the coast has so many options within such easy reach of the car.\n\nWe buy our licenses and go looking for butters, which are heaven on the half-shell with garlic on the grill. A local says she’ll show us how to clean them later at the public cleaning stations. We catch a negative tide near Charleston and stomp out into the muck. The sun is a nickel in the sky. Even the seagulls seem content.\n\nMy wife and I so often spend our days working hard, meeting deadlines and racing to meetings. Out here in the soft spaces borrowed from the sea we are at the mercy of something as big as and free as the moon. Together, clamming, we steal the moments left to us, when everything peels away and we simply enjoy each other’s company.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66688\" style=\"width: 365px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"size-large wp-image-66688\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"Clamming Coos Bay\" width=\"355\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed.jpg 355w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed-80x120.jpg 80w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed-88x133.jpg 88w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Clamming Coos Bay\n  /p\n/div\n\nSuccess\n\nWe find a cigar-shaped hole and dig, letting the smooth blade sigh through the sand. It lands on something firm maybe eight inches down. A clam? What kind! The excitement would seem silly if it didn’t buoy us both. We do this over and over, digging then falling to our hands and knees and clawing through the muck, hole after hole. Butter clams, a few softshells, and a cockle too: They all fall into the bucket like dirty doubloons. Gloves have nothing to do with what we feel, and that is the appeal of Coos Bay.\n\nLearn all about a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\"Coos Bay/a and plan your next adventure!\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_64221\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"size-large wp-image-64221\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/How-to-Go-Clamming-.jpg\" alt=\"From this (first time clammer)\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/How-to-Go-Clamming-.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/How-to-Go-Clamming--200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/How-to-Go-Clamming--254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/How-to-Go-Clamming--120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    From this (first time clammer)&8230;&#8230;\n  /p\n/div\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_64222\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-64222 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fried-Clams-.jpg\" alt=\"Fried Clams\" width=\"600\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fried-Clams-.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fried-Clams--178x133.jpg 178w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    To this (later that day)&#8230;..\n  /p\n/div\n",

David was a PVT in the US Army. He served in Vietnam. There are several military Veterans in this cemetery.\n\nThe Fairview Cemetery has unofficially been the destination cemetery used for the “John & Jane Doe’s” in the county. It has been told that the “John Doe” cemetery started back in the 1950’s when a young man was found dead in the woods not far from Fairview. His cause of death was never determined, and no one claimed his body. He was buried in an unmarked grave under a tree. A few residence of Fairview know which tree he is buried under, but to a passing visitor, they’d never know. Several other “unknown’s” have been buried in the Fairview Cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery has an equal amount of the older upright headstone and the newer flat “lawn” style headstones. Make sure you visit the cemetery during the day, for the cemetery is on private property, but it is open to the public to visit anytime when the gate is open.\n\nBullard Family Cemetery\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66819\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\nimg class=\"size-large wp-image-66819\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8316837orig-674x449.jpg\" alt=\"Bullard Family Cemetery\" width=\"674\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8316837orig-674x449.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8316837orig-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8316837orig-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8316837orig-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8316837orig.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n\np class=\"wp-caption-text\"\nBullard Family Cemetery\n/p\n/div\n\nNestled high atop a forested sand dune hill and quietly overlooking the campers on loop “C”, of the Bullards State Park campground, a lonely cemetery rests peacefully. This small family cemetery is well preserved and hidden amongst the Huckleberry, Salal, wild Rhododendron, Hemlock and large Shore Pines. If you were camping in loop “C” and didn’t adventure out on your own, you would never know a cemetery was near with headstones quietly standing, as if watching the activities of the campground below.\n\nRobert W. Bullard, for whom the bridge is named, migrated to Coos County from Iowa, in 1877. In 1882 Bullard established a general store and ferry crossing that operated from the north bank of the Coquille River.\n\nToday, the only visible trace of any sort of working community once existing in this area is the diminutive cemetery bearing the thirteen gravestones of three related pioneer families. Robert Bullard is buried here along with his wife, Malinda, a descendant of the Hamblocks and Longs, two of their six children, and other relatives.\n\nTo search out this cemetery on your own, it will be difficult to know where to find it. The Bullards State Park does not openly advertise the cemetery’s location in order to protect the delicate headstones from vandals. Though not advertized, it is open to the public to go visit. For directions, just stop by the campground registration booth, or the camp host for directions.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66820\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\nimg class=\"size-large wp-image-66820\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5403575orig-674x449.jpg\" alt=\"Bullard Family Cemetery\" width=\"674\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5403575orig-674x449.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5403575orig-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5403575orig-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5403575orig-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5403575orig.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n\np class=\"wp-caption-text\"\nBullard Family Cemetery\n/p\n/div\n\nNorway “Pioneer” Cemetery\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66821\" style=\"width: 572px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\nimg class=\"wp-image-66821 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/combineimages.jpg\" alt=\"Norway \"Pioneer\" Cemetery\" width=\"562\" height=\"838\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/combineimages.jpg 562w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/combineimages-80x120.jpg 80w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/combineimages-89x133.jpg 89w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /\n\np class=\"wp-caption-text\"\nNorway “Pioneer” Cemetery is filled with poignant reminders of loss families endured when deadly diseases swept through the Coquille River Valley, taking the lives of many infants and children.\n/p\n/div\n\nThe Norway Cemetery is one of the oldest cemeteries in Coos County dating back to 1875. The Cemetery has an unusual distinction unlike any other cemetery in Coos County. There is a tremendous amount of infants and very young children buried here. In the early 1900’s and into the 1920’s, a variety of deadly diseases like diphtheria, smallpox, and measles swept through the Coquille River Valley killing a large portion of the children.\n\nSo many children were dying that a place for burial was needed immediately. With the location proximity between Coquille, Arago, and Myrtle Point, and that it only cost $50 to bury a child in the cemetery, the Norway Cemetery became the destination for immediate burials. The year 1920 was an especially deadly year for the families with infant children of the Coquille Valley.\n\nOne year-old Eleanor Endicott died of Dysentery in 1920, eleven month old William Barklow died of Influenza in 1920.  According to the headstone belonging to the Johnston family, hardship of loss was severe and most likely, emotionally devastating. In 1905, the birth of a daughter named Opal was cut short when she died in the same year. Five years later, twin girls were born in 1910, but their lives were also cut short when both died in the same year of their birth. It is unclear of how the girls died.\n\nThe Norway Cemetery resides on a steep grassy hillside surrounded by a forest of Douglas Fir, Hemlock, and the rare Myrtlewood. This is not a cemetery for the weak of knees. The hill is steep and sliding or falling is common. Lawn mowing maintenance is tricky with such steep slopes, but the cemetery is kept up nicely.\n\nSeveral names that played huge rolls in the development of the towns throughout the Coquille River Valley can be found throughout the cemetery grounds.\n\nGravelford Pioneer Cemetery\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66822\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\nimg class=\"size-large wp-image-66822\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6073247orig-674x449.jpg\" alt=\"Gravelford Pioneer Cemetery\" width=\"674\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6073247orig-674x449.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6073247orig-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6073247orig-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6073247orig-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6073247orig.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n\np class=\"wp-caption-text\"\nGravelford Pioneer Cemetery\n/p\n/div\n\nOne of the finest examples of a small country cemetery being overtaken by the growth of a healthy forest would have to be the Gravelford Pioneer Cemetery established in 1884. From the gravel road, you can’t see the cemetery. It’s hidden up on a hillside underneath a dense canopy of a thriving forest. With the growth of the trees, less sunlight reaches the forest floor, keeping the place dark, damp, and mysterious. More and more of what was once new, is being embraced by the encroachment of the forest cycle.\n\nThe inscription on William Albert Bright’s headstone reads, “Lost to sight yet dear to memory”. Such words coincides with the grounds of the cemetery being lost in the forest.\n\nTo gain a sense of the harsh reality of what life was like in the county-side in the 1920’s, then this cemetery will reveal such struggles, and accidents, and hardships.\n\nThe dominate families in the cemetery are the Hobson’s, Bright’s and Shook’s. All these families struggled with unexpected losses. James Hobson died from a cerebral hemorrhage due to a gun shot wound, Members of the Bright family died from pneumonia and apoplexy; Morgan Shook died from drowning, Milo Shook died from blood poisoning and Carrie Shook died of chronic valvular heart disease.\n\nLife on the farm was not easy and these families are witness to such hardships. Two-and-a-half year-old J.H. Chandler died in 1884, the same year the cemetery was established. Over the years, a healthy growing Douglas Fir’s roots have been encroaching upon the headstone, “hugging” it around its base.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_66825\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\nimg class=\"size-large wp-image-66825\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9331431orig-1-674x449.jpg\" alt=\"Historical Cemetery\" width=\"674\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9331431orig-1-674x449.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9331431orig-1-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9331431orig-1-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9331431orig-1-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9331431orig-1.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n\np class=\"wp-caption-text\"\nTwo-and-a-half year-old J.H.

Suddenly everything has perspective: our problems and mistakes, our challenges and dreams, our values and priorities. To walk amongst the headstones digesting that all we take with us are our deeds and who we have become, what potential we have realized and the value of our service to those we love. A cemetery is authoritative in its unassuming way of humbling us, and yet empowering in its wake-up call for us to appreciate what we have here and now and all the opportunities and pleasures life offers.\n\nAbout the Author & Photographer:\n\nSteven Michael is an award winning photographer, a published author, and illustrator who has lived on the Oregon Coast for most of his life.

        "content": "There are plenty of fish in the sea!\n\nYou may have heard, but fishing is in no short supply here on Oregon&8217;s Adventure Coast. It&#8217;s no wonder, since Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston has a bounty of incredible fishing options! Summer is the perfect time to go a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay/\" target=\"_blank\"saltwater fishing/a on the beach and/or in the Pacific Ocean. In fact, saltwater fishing is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities during this time of year.\n\nThanks to the many charter boat companies in this area, fishermen of all levels can venture offshore for salmon, halibut, Albacore tuna and a variety of bottomfish – from lingcod, to rockfish, to flatfish. Charter boat operators can help plan half-day and full-day trips for any size group. Here is a list of some of our local companies to get you started:\n\np style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"\n  Charleston &#8211; Betty Kay Charters  a href=\"http://www.bettykaycharters.com/\" target=\"_blank\"www.bettykaycharters.com/a\n/p\n\np style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"\n  Coos Bay &#8211; Pacific Charter Services  a href=\"http://www.pacificcharterservices.net/\" target=\"blank\" class=\"brokenlink\"www.pacificcharterservices.net/a\n/p\n\np style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"\n  Charleston &#8211; Prowler Charters  a href=\"http://prowlercharters.com/fishing/\" target=\"_blank\"prowlercharters.com/fishing/a\n/p\n\nIf casting your line from shore sounds more appealing, you can choose from a number of locations for a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/docs/ODFWOutdoorsSurfPerchFlyerFinal.pdf \" target=\"_blank\"surf fishing/a including Horsfall Beach, Bastendorff Beach and Cape Arago State Park where anglers can find striped bass and surf perch. Please note, whenever surf fishing, consult tidal charts, weather conditions and beware that sneaker waves occur on the Oregon Coast.\n\nRemember to NEVER turn your back on the ocean.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_67119\" style=\"width: 324px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-67119\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Wilson-Steelhead11-674x668-674x668.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Vonderohe\" width=\"314\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Wilson-Steelhead11-674x668.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Wilson-Steelhead11-674x668-134x133.jpg 134w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Local fishing expert, Gary Vonderohe\n  /p\n/div\n\n Gary Vonderohe&#8217;s Saltwater Fishing Tips\n\nWhen it comes to current conditions, seasonal tips and catch limits, Gary Vonderohe is the person we turn to.\n\nA Fish Biologist with the  a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/\" target=\"_blank\"Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife /ain Charleston, Gary knows where fishermen can go to find the best saltwater fishing options this summer and wants to pass on his tips to you.\n\nSalmon Fishing\n\nMost Pacific salmon fishing occurs April through November, and sport seasons are regulated for Coho and Chinook salmon by state and federal agencies.Gary says that Chinook salmon fishing in the ocean has been open since March 15th, but it has been slow so far this year but will hopefully pick up in July and August. The Selective Coho (fin-clipped) season opened on June 27th and will run through the earlier part of August or when the the 55,000 coho quota if filled. Fishing for fin-clipped coho is usually better in the Coos Bay area early in the season (so now is prime time).\n\n Halibut Fishing\n\nThe Nearshore Halibut season (inside 40-fathom line) will open on July 1st and will continue through October 31st or when the quota of 21,076 pounds is fulfilled. The Summer All-depth Halibut season will begin on August 7-8.\n\nAlbacore Tuna\n\nAlbacore Tuna tend to be offshore from mid summer through early fall. A few Albacore Tuna have already been caught offshore. Fishing for Albacore Tuna has typically been best in late July, August, and sometimes into September but anglers travel 20-30 miles offshore to find the best fishing.\n\n Bottomfish\n\nBottomfish are available year around – weather permitting – and a charter trip usually ends with an ice chest full of fish. Fishing for bottomfish like black rockfish and lingcod has been good all spring and into the early part of summer, but it&#8217;s now restricted to inside the 30-fathom line until the end of September. Since there have been numerous changes, Gary recommends checking with the a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/RR/southwest/\" target=\"_blank\"Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife /a for the most up to date recreation report for bottomfish catch limits.\n\nCrabbing\n\nCrabbing inside Coos Bay has been good so far this year with boat crabbers having the most success. If you don’t have a boat there are lots of docks in Charleston to drop you crab pots from. Crabbing is typically best on either side of the slack tides.\n\n Clamming\n\nThe South Oregon coast, home to numerous bays, is the ideal destination for recreational diggers and we expect tides to be ideal for clamming well into summer and even fall! Clamming for bay clams in Coos Bay is open and is always good on just about any low tide. Razor clamming has been closed along the entire Oregon Coast due to elevated levels of domoic acid.\n\nNow that you&#8217;re in the know, let&#8217;s help you plan your summer fishing trip to Coos Bay!\n\nFor more tips, visit a href=\"http://www.fishingcoosbay.com/ \" target=\"blank\"www.fishingcoosbay.com/a and/or check with the a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/\" target=\"blank\"Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife /afor the most up to date recreation report and visit a href=\"/travelers-guide/fishing-license-requirements/#baitshops\" target=\"blank\"Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast/a for a list of local bait and tackle shops.

That phrase, just four words, is still the best description of the America’s Cup, and how it represents the singular pursuit of excellence.\n\nTroy Sears will take the modern replica of the world’s most famous racing yacht, America, to sailing communities in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. This will give sailing fans of all ages a chance to sail back in time aboard a painstaking replica of the original &#8220;America,&#8221; which in 1851 stunned the world by winning the legendary sailing race around the Isle of Wight and won the trophy that now bears her name, the America’s Cup!\n\nThe tour launched in July 2015 out of San Diego, California, and the yacht America will embark on a North American voyage, serving as an official ambassador of the America’s Cup.\n",

Weekend trips by members of the Pacific Railcar Operators will include stops at Sturdivant Park in Coquille and at the Oregon Coast Historical Railway museum and display area in Coos Bay, where fans can get a closer look and talk to crew members.\n\nThe railroad museum will be open for extended hours during both visits, and offer cookies and refreshments.\n\nAlso known as putt-putts, motor cars, and jiggers, the little maintenance vehicles were a fixture on railroads worldwide, eventually to be replaced by trucks that could run on both rails and pavement.\n\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-67442\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG0126-e1441317438302-674x506.jpg\" alt=\"IMG0126\" width=\"674\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG0126-e1441317438302-674x506.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG0126-e1441317438302-177x133.jpg 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n\nThe vintage vehicles are meticulously restored by fans and often feature careful reproductions of paint schemes and logos, as well as the proverbial “all the bells and whistles.” On many runs, one of the speeders pulls a communal portable toilet, while another – staffed by a trained medical crew member – has emergency-vehicle markings.\n\nAccording to Bill Andrews of the Pacific Railroad Operators, both trips will begin in Vaughn, near Veneta, on Friday, Sept. 12 and Friday, Sept. 26 respectively, and head to an overnight stop at Coos Bay’s Red Lion Inn. The groups will proceed to Coquille at about 9 a.m. the next morning, with a lunch break at Sturdivant Park at about noon. The public is welcome to view the speeders and visit with their crews.\n\nThe group will return to Coos Bay, stopping at the OCHR museum at about 2:30 p.m. This is another opportunity to look over the vehicles and visit with their crews. The group will conclude the day’s journey adjacent to the Red Lion Inn in Coos Bay. They’ll depart the next day at about 8 a.m., with a return to Vaughn at approximately 6 p.m.\n\nSee website and contact information at www.pro-online.org, or check out the site of the North American Railcar Operators Association at www.narcoa.org.

        "content": "The outstanding service and food experienced by restaurant patrons in our local dining establishments are one of the best kept secrets on Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast. Foodies from all over the region have told us time and time again how surprised they were in the quality and the selection of the restaurants in our area.\n\nWe&#8217;re not surprised at all. In downtown Coos Bay alone, hungry travelers can find top notch Sushi, Thai, Italian, Mexican, Local Fish and American comfort food within blocks of each other! We asked around to find out what the favorite restaurants are among visitors, and thought we&#8217;d pass this info along to you.\n\nHere are some Coos Bay restaurants worth checking out in 2016. _ Don&#8217;t worry- we&#8217;re highlighting the best restaurants in North Bend and Charleston next!_\n\na href=\"http://www.littleitalycb.com/\" target=\"_blank\"Little Italy /a\n\nIn the mood for a taste of Italy? You can&8217;t go wrong at Little Italy, ranked #1 for Coos Bay restaurants TripAdvisor. Frequent visitors praise the restaurant for it&#8217;s outstanding service, food, and cozy ambiance. For a real treat try the Osso Bucco, gnocchi pesto and another reviewer says that their Fettuccine Alfredo was the creamiest, smoothest they&#8217;ve ever tasted!\n\nOne visitor from Washington posted that Little Italy is a &#8220;must&#8221; for dining whenever they visit the area. &#8220;During this last trip we had dinner there twice and had lunch also. The lunch menu was as wonderful as dinner,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The food here has always been marvelous. A real taste of Italy. It&#8217;s hard to eat Italian anywhere else after eating here&#8221;.\n\na href=\"http://www.citysubs1.com/\" target=\"_blank\"City Subs/a\n\nIf you like sandwiches, (and who doesn&8217;t?) this is a great place to fuel up in Coos Bay. City Subs is one of the top ranked restaurants in Coos Bay for a reason. Known for their freshly baked homemade bread, generous portions (they don&#8217;t skimp on the good stuff) and very friendly service. &#8220;Truly as good as it gets! The fresh baked good is flavorful and light, you don&#8217;t get more bread than ingredients,&#8221; raved a recent visitor on a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/city-subs-coos-bay\" target=\"_blank\"Yelp/a. &#8220;Wow. That was full of exceptional Nom. Fresh baked homemade bread. Fresh ingredients. Fast service,&#8221; said another.\n\n&#8220;I watched how the staff interacted with their customers, and it was clear that City Subs is a place where the locals eat, where everyone knows everyone,&#8221; another visitor recently posted. We recommend stopping in and try their pastrami melt while answering some Coos Bay trivia at your table.\n\na href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/fishermens-seafood-market-coos-bay\" target=\"_blank\"Fishermen’s Seafood Market/a\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  strong“Great food that is always fresh!”br / &8220;BEST fish and chips&#8221;br / “Surprise! Best meal of my trip”br / “Freshest Fish Anywhere”/strong\n/p\n\nNeed we say more? This floating fish market, famous for their made-from-scratch clam chowder, can be found off the Coos Bay City Docks. The dinning area is very small and tends to feel more like a carry out counter with a few seats, but the food is worth it! Their fish case is filled with fresh seafood they caught themselves or purchased directly from local fishing boats. Try one of their baskets, featuring hand cut and breaded rock fish, clams (harvested by them), prawns and oysters.\n\na href=\"http://www.tokyocoosbay.com/\" target=\"_blank\"Tokyo Bistro/a\n\nVisitors can&8217;t stop raving about this local gem, known for very fresh Sushi and tasty Tempura. One reviewer says &#8220;top notch, serving great food. I&#8217;ve never been disappointed in the service.&#8221;\n\nHot tip: &#8220;Tucked behind the Bistro is Edna&#8217;s Bakery, not to be missed! Edna has been baking for years and supplying local restaurants with baked goods. Give them a try, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.\n\na href=\"http://www.blueheronbistro.net/\" target=\"_blank\"Blue Heron Bistro/a\n\nIn the mood for something unique?

        "content": "Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast is a haven for foodies and sport eaters alike. You may have seen our top five Coos Bay eateries to hit up in 2016, and the time has come for us to reveal our top 5 restaurants that North Bend has to offer this new year. From Seafood to Pancakes to Italian to Mediterranean, North Bend will have you spoiled for choice come time to dine out.\n\nu1) Ciccarelli&8217;s/u\n\nThis Italian restaurant/bakery is touted by patrons as not only the best Italian you will find in North Bend but instead the best you&#8217;ll find in the entire Oregon Coast area! A charming interior and stunning garden patio ensure you&#8217;ll find your zen while dining here.  Must-tries include the French onion soup, prawns, and wood-fire roasted artisanal pizzas.\n\nOne customer notes &#8220;the steak and prawns we ordered were out of this world good. Haven&#8217;t had a steak like that in years. Perfectly seasoned and beautiful medium cooked steak, big juicy prawns and a house Merlot to blend it all together.&#8221; If that doesn&#8217;t get your mouth watering then nothing will. They sum up Ciccarelli&#8217;s perfectly: &#8220;Pretty darn dreamy.&#8221;\n\nu2) The Liberty Pub/u\n\nSome days you just need to kick back and relax. On those days, there&8217;s one place you should go: The Liberty Pub. Though the laid back atmosphere is great, it&#8217;s the menu that steals the spotlight. A great selection of beers, fish and chips, shepherds pie, pub rolls, pizza, and more await you in this pub.\n\nOf course, for those days you want a little more excitement, The Liberty Pub also provides live music! Great food and great tunes ensure this place is THE place to relax after a long day at work.\n\nu3) Cafe Mediterranean/u\n\nWait, authentic Mediterranean cuisine in North Bend? You&8217;d better believe it! Cafe Mediterranean&#8217;s authentic Lebanese cuisine and tremendous service make it a must visit for anyone passing through. With delectable Shawarmas, incredible dips (Spicy feta dip! Spinach and Artichoke dip!), and unbeatable gyros and kabobs, this place is a must for any foodie looking to stray from the norm.\n\n&#8220;Back in the day, when we&#8217;d drive through Coos Bay and North Bend, our only options were burgers, burgers, and more burgers. But not anymore. This place is amazing!&#8221; A visitor from California writes. &#8221; We&#8217;ll definitely stop here again when we&#8217;re on the coast. It was nice to find such a little jewel of a restaurant in such an unexpected place.&#8221;\n\nu4) Yeong&8217;s Place/u\n\nWhen the taste for good burgers takes hold, nothing else will do. That&#8217;s why Yeong&#8217;s Place is as popular as it is, known for making the best burgers in North Bend (and beyond)! With a variety of meats available such as elk, bison, and salmon and a large selection of toppings and burger styles, you&#8217;re bound to find the perfect burger for you at Yeong&#8217;s. Take it from us, you can&#8217;t go beat the Garbage Burger and sweet potato fries.\n\n&#8220;It&#8217;s quite hard to put into words just how good burgers are from Yeong&#8217;s. It&#8217;s like I would want heaven to be when I die I guess. Simply amazing every time I go.&#8221;\n\nu5) Pancake Mill Restaurant and Pie Shoppe/u\n\n&8220;I didn&#8217;t think it was possible to find a five-star pancake house, but this place represents the kind of food all pancake houses should aspire to achieve.&#8221; That really tells you all you need to know about the Pancake Mill Restaurant. It&#8217;s no surprise that at 190 reviews, Pancake Mill Restaurant stands as North Bend&#8217;s top rated restaurant on TripAdvisor.\n\nAn assortment of delicious baked goods (did somebody say giant muffins?) and breakfast platters complete with homemade fruit syrups await you at the Pancake Mill. The real star of the show, however, is the Dutch Apple Pancake, a must try for any patron of the Pancake Mill.  Bring a big appetite when you visit or you may end up taking food home with you! But really, would that be so wrong?\n\nSo there you have it! Our top five North Bend restaurants to try in 2016. Of course, there&#8217;s plenty of more excellent options you can also find in North Bend.  Bon appetit!\n\n&nbsp;\n",

        "content": "Updated Feb 2019\n\nSpring is right around the corner and the need for fresh-aired exploration can be too great to ignore. Fortunately, there is the perfect solution right here on Oregon’s South Coast. Pack your bag, grab a camera, get your hiking boots on, and take a day trip a href=\"http://alltrails.com/parks/us/oregon/golden-and-silver-falls-state-natural-area\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area/a, “a hidden gem in the dense coastal forests” in our region.\n\n“Hard to find, but worth the effort,” posted this a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=golden%20and%20silver%20falls&lrd=0x54c3f3a384e2d9e9:0x525b0ff0af984bd8,1,,\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"recent visitor/a. “The falls were absolutely gorgeous. If I had not been on a time schedule, I would have stayed so much longer simply to watch them. It is a relatively short hike to each of the waterfalls- Golden Falls to the right side of the park, and Silver Falls to the left,” posted another.\n\nYes hikers, trekkers, and all-around nature lovers, a href=\"http://alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/golden-and-silver-falls\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Golden and Silver Falls/a is a a href=\"http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dspparkPage&parkId=67\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Coos County State Natural Area/a and the ideal place to unwind and reconnect with nature for a day. It’s about a 30-minute ride from Coos Bay and worth the trip.\n\nParking and picnic areas await you at the bottom of the hiking trails, and after you get your grub on you can spend the day trekking up Golden and Silver Falls’ scenic routes. And for those of you that may need a little extra convincing, did we mention there are waterfalls?! That’s right, a relatively short hike leads to breathtaking waterfalls shooting out onto boulders a hundred feet below. We could tell you more, but why not show you?\n\nGolden and Silver Falls’ trails are accessible by all skill levels so don’t worry about struggling as you make your way through. Dogs are welcome too so feel free to bring man’s best friend with you just as long as they’re kept on their leash! Along the way you’ll have the chance to enjoy stunning river views, the majestic Oregon myrtle trees, and other amazing photo opportunities.\n\nGetting ready for your trek to the falls? Consider these tips to make the most of your day!\n\nBring Drinking Water\n\nIt’s important to stay hydrated when hiking so be sure to bring a drinking bottle with you. A refillable bottle is recommended so you don’t have to worry about pitching any waste afterwards (plus it’s better for the environment).\n\n Use Sunblock\n\nEven if it’s overcast you should wear sunblock when hiking! Do yourself a favor in the long-run and stick to this tip.\n\nWear a Hat\n\nSimilarly, wear a hat to give yourself some shade! If it’s a sunny day you’ll be thankful you have it, and if it rains… well, you’ll be thankful you have it, too.\n\n Wear Proper Hiking Boots\n\nWe can’t stress this enough, wear shoes with a proper grip for hiking. Sneakers are not enough as trails could have loose dirt or be rendered slick with the weather and you’ll need the extra traction that proper boots provide.\n\nHike In a Group\n\nIt’s recommended to hike in a group whenever possible. Not only does it make for a much more enjoyable time but you’ll be able to keep an eye on one another and avoid potentially problematic situations.\n\n Bring Small Snacks\n\nIt’s better to munch on small snacks for energy as opposed to waiting for a big post-hike lunch!\n\nLeave The Area Better Than You Found It\n\nThis is the golden rule for any nature preserve (or anywhere else for that matter). If you bring trash be sure to toss it in a proper receptacle when you’re done with it. If you see someone else’s trash along the way why not pick it up and toss it too?\n\nThis tip also extends to leaving nature as you found it; so don’t pick flowers, break boulders, carve trees, or any other such behavior. When in doubt leave it alone.\n\nBut really,  the most important thing is to be safe and have a great time! With Golden and Silver Falls you’re guaranteed an extraordinary day away from the noise of the city and the complexities of modern life.\n\nA note about the drive up Hwy 241. Please be aware that the road leading up to the parking area for Golden & Silver Falls is, at times, only one lane and more dirt than pavement. Take the drive slowly to avoid any potentially dangerous situations, including meeting other vehicles traveling in the opposite direction and rough traveling conditions. Believe us when we say, the drive up is part of the adventure! And well worth the effort.",

In that time it&#8217;s become the place to go for movies, live music, and events.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_71613\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\n  img class=\"size-large wp-image-71613\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ET8-674x448.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian Theatre 1925\" width=\"674\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ET8-674x448.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ET8-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ET8-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ET8-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ET8.jpg 698w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    A look at the Egyptian Theatre&#8217;s earliest days. Photo Source Egyptiantheatreoregon.com\n  /p\n/div\n\nDid You Say 1925?!\n\nThat&8217;s right, it first started back in 1925 right in the heart of downtown Coos Bay. But did you know it wasn&#8217;t always a theatre? In 1922 the space was originally constructed as the Motor Inn Garage and Service station but it was meant to be, however, as it was right around this moment that a major historical event transpired: King Tutankhamen’s tomb was unearthed.\n\nThe American public was fascinated by the allure and mysteries of ancient Egypt, leading to an adoption of what is now known as Egyptian Revival style. The Motor Inn Garage and Service Station was shut down due to building restrictions and the space took on a new form: The Egyptian Theatre.\n\nThe Theatre has changed ownership throughout the years, finally being purchased by The City of Coos Bay Urban Renewal Agency in 2006. With the enlisted help of nonprofit a href=\"http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/membership-info/\" target=\"_blank\"Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association/a, they have transformed the venue into a showcase for classic and educational movies, hosted concerts, special events, and community celebrations.\n\nThis theatre was recently featured on a href=\"http://kcby.com/features/western-oregon-living\" target=\"_blank\"KCBY&#8217;s Western Oregon Living/a. Take a look-\n\nWhat Does It Offer?\n\nIf classic entertainment for an affordable price is what you&8217;re after then the Egyptian Theatre is the place for you. There&#8217;s something just right about watching classic cinema in a historical venue like the Egyptian Theatre, you know? It&#8217;s also a great spot to watch live music, oftentimes for free. Oh, and did we mention they offer Beer-and-Movie nights?\n\nThe easiest way to know what&#8217;s upcoming is to visit their a href=\"http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/future-events/\" target=\"_blank\"Future Events/a page.\n\nSo You&8217;re Saying People Like This Place?\n\nThat&#8217;s putting it lightly! Here are just a couple of reviews from the Egyptian Theatre&#8217;s Tripadvisor page:\n\n&#8220;Have come to over 10 performances here in the last several years. A truly jaw dropping interior that is one of a kind, and really brings back the spirit of the roaring 20&#8217;s. Visit if you have a chance!&#8220;\n\n&#8220;I absolutely love the movies we see there. We saw the Minions recently. We also saw the old Mummy with Boris Karloff. The popcorn is fabulous. The seats are comfortable and you can see from every seat. We will keep going back.&#8220;\n\n&#8220;I love this place and so nice to see it alive. Have enjoyed many of the things going on, a nice place to spend an evening out. Terrific job by those who run it and those who put it all together.&#8220;\n\n&#8220;This is like a trip back in time. The decor is original, and the feel reminds me of going to the movies back when I was a kid. A definite classic experience. Seats are very comfortable, great snack bar, clean restrooms!&#8220;\n\nI&8217;m Sold!\n\nWe&#8217;re glad to hear it! The Egyptian Theatre is a special part of Coos Bay&#8217;s history and one that should be experienced by everyone at least once. If you want classic entertainment then you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find better.\n\nAs we previously mentioned the Egyptian Theatre is run by non-profit efforts and passionate volunteers. If you&#8217;d like to get involved then reach out to the a href=\"http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/volunteer-info/\" target=\"_blank\"Egyptian Theatre/a and help keep this historic landmark up and running for future generations of visitors.\n",

        "title": "Your Guide to Beach-Combing and Tide-Pooling on Oregon's Adventure Coast ",
        "content": "There is much to love about visiting Oregon's Adventure Coast, but the miles and miles of beautiful, undeveloped beaches may be one of our greatest natural assets. The beaches on Oregon's South Coast are ideal for anyone searching for a quiet, undisturbed spot to watch the tide roll in and out. They are also perfect for those looking for a place to surf, swim, walk the dogs or search for hidden beach treasures.\n\nIf beach-combing, tide-pooling, picnicking, whale watching, surfing and clamming or other popular pastimes are on your Oregon Coast wish list, look no further than our very own beaches and be sure to follow these tips to stay safe & protect our natural habitat. Visitors going to the beach should be aware of coastal safety hazards with the potential danger of undertows, sneaker waves and rolling logs. Click here for Beach Safety Tips.\n\nBeach-Combing & Tide-Pooling Tips\n\nConsider these tips below to stay safe and make the most of your coastline expeditions.\n\n 1.  Check the Tides Charts\n\nWhen beach-combing and tide-pooling it’s crucial to make sure the tide is out during the time you’ll be on the beach. Visit www.tides4fishing.com and/or www.tideschart.com for an easy-to-use tide chart for the Coos Bay area.\n\n2.  Wear Shoes/Boots with Grip\n\nJust because it’s the beach does not mean there will be any shortage of sharp surfaces and potentially harmful objects. Bring shoes with grip to ensure you’ll keep your footing as you make your way down paths to the beach and to keep your feet safe.\n\n 3.  Watch Where You Step\n\nThis tip goes hand in hand with the previous one. When the tide goes out it’s likely to leave behind slick, slick seaweed. Stepping on it can result in a vicious fall and potential serious injury. Tread heavy and carefully.\n\n4.  Do Not Remove Attached Animals\n\nThough the temptation may be to grab a critter you see, keep in mind that doing so can bring damage to the organism and even ecosystem as a whole.\n\n 5.  Don’t Leave Rocks Overturned\n\nSimilarly, rocks provide a crucial part of the ecosystem of many of the organisms you’ll see when tide-pooling. By leaving rocks overturned you can negatively influence the ecosystem and disrupt different species.\n\n6. Leave it Better Than You Found it\n\nThis one is a good rule in general but goes double when you are visiting the beaches. Bring a bag with you to pick up after your own trash and if you’re so inclined to pick up any stray pieces of garbage you come across. Not only are you doing your part to help the environment but you’re also beautifying the area for other visitors.\n\n 7. Bring a Camera\n\nYou’ll be seeing some beautiful sights along these beach spots, we strongly recommend taking some pictures as you do so.\n\nBest Places for Beach-combing and Tide-pooling\n\nBelow are some of our favorite spots for beach-combing, picnicking, and tide-pooling.\n\nBastendorff Beach- A favorite among surfers, kite flyers, beachcombers, locals and tourists alike. You’ll find uninterrupted beach and ocean views can be enjoyed here. Bastendorff Beach is defined by Yoakam Head and the south jetty at the entrance of the bay. Located ¼ mile off the Cape Arago Highway. Never crowded and always beautiful, Bastendorff Beach is a must see for beach enthusiasts. Click here for more info. Address: 63379 Bastendorff Beach Road Charleston, OR 97420\n\nSunset Bay State Park- A favorite among locals and tourists, Sunset Bay State Park is protected by towering sea cliffs and features beautiful sandy beaches, amazing tide pools, picnic facilities, restrooms, and campgrounds.

Learn more.  89814 Cape Arago Highway Charleston, OR 97420\n\nCape Arago State Park- Tucked away below the cliffs, a short walk along the steep trails will take you to a secluded cove where tide-pools and fossils can be found on Cape Arago Beach.

Two trails can be found here for excellent hiking opportunities; the south trails leads to poolsides full of a variety of sea life, and the north trail lets visitors view offshore colonies of seals and sea lions.

The beach is popular with surfers, kayakers, and birdwatchers and offers slight protection from cross currents and wind due to the rocky headlands framing the beach. Since the beach does not have a parking lot, most visitors park along the Cape Arago Highway, near the intersection of Lighthouse Way, and walk down a path to the beach. The beach can also be accessed via kayak, launching from Sunset Bay State Park or Bastendorff Beach County Park. Click here for more info.\nCape Arago Loop, Charleston\n\nHorsfall Beach- Beautiful secluded beach located within the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Great place for beach-combing and has plenty of parking, lots of uninterrupted beach, great for pets and kids and many other natural amenities. Learn more \nHorsefall Beach Rd, North Bend, OR 97459\n\nSimpson Beach- situated directly below Shore Acres State Park. A winding path takes you to a secluded ocean cove where you’ll find crashing waves, migrating whales, and views of hundreds of seals and sea lions and other wildlife. Please do not bother the seal pups you may find on the beach. They are not lost, only waiting for mom to return. Learn more. 89814 Cape Arago Hwy Charleston, OR 97420",

If you are looking for a great hike then you need to try Bluebill trail!* *Located off Horsfall Road , this trail loops around a seasonal lake which is home to different species of birds and aquatic animals. Bring your camera and binoculars to view the sights!\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&8220;We could not get enough of this place!!!!! First off, we under-estimated the massive size of the dunes and set off on a picnic lunch hike on the &#8220;beach&#8221; with our lunch, 1 liter of water for 2 of us and a bottle of wine. After hiking for 1.5 miles on the dunes, the beach was still no-where in site, our water was gone, and we realized ( should have read the sign at the beginning of the trail) that the ocean was in fact another 1.5 miles over the dunes. With mainly wine as a re-hydration liquid we decided to abort the long, hot hike and headed back to our vehicle. The following day we hiked once again on the dunes this time with plenty of water and the next day we rented quads and explored the dunes. Soooooo amazing.&#8221;/em\n/p\n\na href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/dsl/ssnerr/pages/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve/a\n\nThe trails at South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR) are one of Oregon&8217;s best kept secrets. In addition to it&#8217;s unbeatable natural surroundings, SSNERR hikers have access to some of the best birding spots that Oregon has to offer, so be sure to bring binoculars with you! We recommend downloading a a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SSNERR/Pages/maps.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"free trail map/a if you&#8217;re planning to make the trek!\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;Beautiful. Lots of cool mushrooms to discover if your very observant. If you go you must walk through the tunnel trail. Perfect trail for a small day hike.&#8221;/em\n/p\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;This is a well-maintained fairly heavily trafficked trail that allows visitors to view a variety of habitat types. There are tons of mushrooms and other tiny hidden gems, some picturesque scenes of the slough, and a neat walk through a more marshy area with a raised wood trail. Its worth a visit, especially if you like to take photos, but not very strenuous.&#8221;/em\n/p\n\na href=\"http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=70\" target=\"_blank\"Sunset Bay State Park/a\n\nHiking, beaches, camping, fishing&8230; these are just a few of the things that await you at Sunset Bay State Park. Hiking trails connect Sunset Bay to Cape Arago and Shore Acres, so you can actually make your way from one park to another and get the best of both worlds! While you&#8217;re making your way through the trail be sure to stop and enjoy the views of Gregory Point and Cape Arago Lighthouse.\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;One of the most stunning trails I have ever been on. A easy walk especially with kids with plenty of beautiful vistas of the ocean and rock formations. /ememYou need to walk along the side of the road for 100 feet to continue the coastal walk. /ememWOW!!!!&#8221;/em\n/p\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;Just beautiful and well maintained&#8221;/em\n/p\n\na href=\"http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=66\" target=\"_blank\"Cape Arago State Park/a\n\np style=\"text-align: left;\"\n  This scenic, oceanfront trail is the perfect option for anyone looking to catch a glimpse of wildlife, do a little fishing, or just get some serious hiking time in. Located 15 minutes from Coos Bay, this trail provides an unbeatable opportunity to lose yourself in nature.\n/p\n\np style=\"text-align: left;\"\n  strongNote: the trail is closed March 1- June 30 to protect seal pups (and they need protecting)./strong\n/p\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&8220;I live in coos bay, and visit the parks year round. There&#8217;s no better place to feel the power of the ocean than here on a stormy day. Also seal and whale watching, and some hiking here. If you visit this area, make the 15 minute trip out of the city of coos bay to come here. It&#8217;s beautiful!&#8221;/em\n/p\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;You won&#8217;t want to miss hiking around here and to see this unique ocean shore. It is the Oregon Coast at its finest.&#8221;/em\n/p\n\na href=\"http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=68\" target=\"_blank\"Shore Acres State Park/a\n\nRugged sandstone cliffs provide the ideal hiking spot in this stunning State Park. Furthermore, Shore Acres offers perfect spots to picnic and enjoy the view midway through the hiking trail. Be sure to bring a camera with you for the all but certain wildlife photo opportunities you&8217;ll encounter.\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;Everything about this area is beautiful from the hiking trails to the gardens. Amazing ocean views, interesting history, marine wildlife and even views of the Coquille lighthouse. They have a wonderful gift shop too and kind and helpful volunteers. Even the drive to the gardens is beautiful on a foggy morning. Don&#8217;t miss this place!&#8221;/em\n/p\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;We are locals, and often go to Shore Acres for the nice hikes, watching storm waves and, of course, the remarkable gardens. The Christmas light display is amazing.&#8221;/em\n/p\n\na href=\"http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=67\" target=\"_blank\"Golden and Silver Falls/a\n\nThis suggest may be somewhat cheating since we recently did an a href=\"/2016/02/adventure-spotlight-golden-and-silver-falls/\" target=\"_blank\"Adventure Spotlight/a on this very hiking spot, but we&8217;d be doing this post a disservice by not including it on the list. If you didn&#8217;t read the previous post on Golden and Silver Falls then let us sum it up for you: Incredible hiking vistas overlooking waterfalls. Not to shabby, eh?\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  em&#8220;This is truly a hidden gem in the Oregon Coast Range. The drive is about 30 minutes from Coos Bay, with the road being closed about 1 mile from the trailhead. Once there, there were 2 pit toilets to avoid, and a picnic area which would be great if you could bring your car up there&#8211;hopefully they will have the road fixed by summer, as it would be a beautiful place for a BBQ&#8211;they have the forest service style grills there. Golden and Silver Falls are two separate falls, each a short hike on a non-challenging trail. Silver Falls was my favorite, but they are both beautiful and well worth the hike. No water, electricity, or services otherwise there.&#8221;/em\n/p\n\np style=\"text-align: left;\"\n  We believe in &#8220;safety first&#8221; when you&#8217;re on the trail. Be sure to follow these tips to ensure that nothing will break your stride.\n/p\n\nBring Drinking Water\n\nIt’s important to stay hydrated when hiking so be sure to bring a drinking bottle with you. A refillable bottle is recommended so you don’t have to worry about pitching any waste afterwards (plus it’s better for the environment).\n\n Use Sunblock\n\nEven if it’s overcast you should be wear sunblock when hiking! Do yourself a favor in the long-run and stick to this tip.\n\nWear a Hat\n\nSimilarly, wear a hat to give yourself some shade! If it’s a sunny day you’ll be thankful you have it, and if it rains… well, you’ll be thankful you have it.\n\n Wear Proper Hiking Boots\n\nWe can’t stress this enough, wear shoes with a proper grip for hiking. Sneakers are not enough as trails could have loose dirt or be rendered slick with the weather and you’ll be needing the extra traction that proper boots provide.\n\nHike In a Group\n\nIt’s recommended to hike in a group whenever possible. Not only does it make for a much more enjoyable time but you’ll be able to keep an eye on one another and avoid potentially problematic situations.\n\n Bring Small Snacks\n\nIt’s better to munch on small snacks for energy as opposed to waiting for a big post-hike lunch!\n\nLeave The Area Better Than You Found It\n\nThis is the golden rule for any nature preserve (or anywhere else for that matter). If you bring trash be sure to toss it in a proper receptacle when you’re done with it. If you see someone else’s trash along the way why not pick it up and toss it too?\n\nThis tip also extends to nature so don’t pick flowers, break boulders, carve trees, or any other such behavior. When in doubt leave it alone.\n",

Plan your meals ahead of time and your trip to the market will be a fruitful one (pun intended).\n\nstrong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"Know Your Seasons/strong\n\nBy knowing the agricultural seasons you&8217;ll know what produce should be for sale at the farmers&#8217; market and will be able to better plan the meals you&#8217;ll cook. Be sure to check a crop calendar ahead of time to know what produce will be available when (consider a href=\"http://www.usda.gov/oce/weather/CropCalendars/\" target=\"_blank\"this handy one from the USDA/a).\n\nGo Early or Go Late\n\nWith farmers&8217; markets, there are two optimal timings to visit. By going early you can avoid larger crowds and have the best selection to choose from. Popular goods may sell out throughout the day.\n\nBy going to farmers&#8217; markets late you may find better deals. Typically vendors will prefer to sell of their goods at a discounted price rather than packing them up and taking them home. That said, please do span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"not/span ask for (or worse yet, demand) a discounted price. Just be polite and good things will typically happen.\n\nBring Bags\n\nVendors may offer bags, but if you&8217;re buying several pieces of produce and goods you&#8217;ll want to bring your own. Make sure you have a comfortable bag you can\n\nBring Small Change\n\nThough vendors will almost always have the required change you need, the transaction will go a lot quicker if you have exact change.\n\n strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"Get Advice/strong\n\nWhen in doubt, ask questions! These vendors specialize in their wares and produce. If you want to know the combination that will go best with what you&#8217;re cooking, what&#8217;s the optimal way to cook something, or just a good recommendation then be sure to ask! You&#8217;ll always get the help you&#8217;re looking for.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n",

Photo Source: The South Coast Shopper\n  /p\n/div\n\nWhat is the significance of Myrtlewood? Myrtlewood has a rich history here on the South Coast. It is a broadleaf evergreen native to Southwestern Oregon and Northwestern California. It grow prolifically in this coastal region and considered by many to be one of the world’s most beautiful woods by its dense and richly grained qualities and sculpted patterns. During the Great Depression, the town of North Bend actually used Myrtlewood coins as currency.\n\nOn your next Oregon Coast visit, plan to stop by and meet their friendly staff and check out the amazing products they create. You never know what you will find. Read what others had to say:\n\n“A unique store and excellent stop on the coast”\n  \nTake some time to check out this unique store. The myrtlewood products range in price from very reasonable to a little more spendy, but are unique and beautiful. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and when we were there had some free popcorn! The store has more than just the wood &#8211; you can find information, clothing, postcards, and other souvenirs. It is worth the stop, even if you are tight on time!\n\n&#8220;Great Myrtlewood Gifts”\n  \nLots of great myrtlewood items to chose from. This shop was one of the best we stopped at along the coast.\n\n“Cool location in the middle of nowhere”\n  \nApparently this is where a lot of things in the giftshops are made. I didn&#8217;t get to see the master woodcrafter in his workshop when I went, but when the person is there creating items, you can watch him work. When he is not there, you can watch a video of the magic behind the scenes. They have some really funky things there, absolutely beautiful to know it&#8217;s ALL handmade. If you are hungry for some sweets, head to the back and get some of that great fudge and cake there! You also have other edibles preserved in jars that you can buy, it&#8217;s not just all woodwork. This is a great stop for unique presents for loved ones.\n\n“Looking for myrtlewood”\n  \nWe stopped in to get ideas on making myrtlewood bowls. As my husband is into wood crafting after retirement. The tour of their shop was very interesting, we got lots of ideas and learned new things. The tour was free. I enjoyed looking at all the different things made from myrtlewood and bought jewelry, kitchen items plus a nice jacket sweatshirt that I love and can&#8217;t wait to get back and get another one. The workers are all very friendly and good at answering all my husbands questions. They are the best!!!!\n\np style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  strongOregon Connection/House of Myrtlewood/strongbr / 1125 S. 1st Street, P.O.

        "content": "&8220;Captain Bill was wonderful, going out of his way to find a good fishing spot and track down a whale for us.&#8221;\n\nDeep sea fishing along Oregon&#8217;s South Coast is one of the great experiences to be had any time of the year. Few things are more relaxing than chartering a boat and heading out onto the beautiful and mysterious Pacific waters on a fishing excursion.\n\nThere are several a href=\"/featured-adventures/fishing-crabbing-clamming/\" target=\"blank\"Charter Boat Fishing companies/a on Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast, though a href=\"http://www.bettykaycharters.com/\" target=\"blank\"Betty Kay Charters/a is perhaps the most well known and recommended in our area.\n\nFor the last thirty years Captains Bill and Kathi have taken anglers of all skill levels on countless experiences including whale watching and deep sea fishing for halibut, salmon, rock fish, and tuna.

The thing is, when talking about sand riding it&#8217;s possible to mean two very different activities: sand duning and *sand boarding.  *Though they may have their own take on what it means to ride down a sand dune, both are an undeniable blast.\n\nBelow you&#8217;ll find tips for both sand duning and sand boarding to ensure your safety, thus allowing you to have a great time! But first, let&#8217;s explain what each activity consists of, shall we?\n\nWhat is Sand Duning?\n\nSand Duning is the activity comprised of riding a recreational vehicle throughout Sand Dunes.\n\n What is Sandboarding?\n\nSandboarding is very similar to snowboarding, only it takes place on sand dunes instead of a snowy mountainside.\n\nClear on the differences? Great! Now we can get to the fun part, tips and tricks! Let&#8217;s start with Sand Duning, as seen in this video from OregonDuner.\n\nTips for Sand Duning\n\n1. Wear a Helmet\n  \nWhen you&8217;re riding at high speeds on dunes there&#8217;s always the very real possibility of crashing out. Wearing a helmet is a must to keep yourself safe.\n\n2. Stick to Paths and Trails\n  \nBe sure to stick to paths and trails as you&#8217;re making your way to the sand dunes. It&#8217;s not only safer, you&#8217;re less likely to get lost!\n\n3. Obey The Speed Limit\n  \nAs you&#8217;re driving through paths and trails, it&#8217;s crucial to stick to the speed limit. People may be using the other national park areas and will be in danger if you&#8217;re driving recklessly.\n\n4. Don&#8217;t Go Alone\n  \nSand Duning&#8217;s not just more fun with friends, but it&#8217;s safer too! Minimize your risk by bringing some buddies along.\n\n5. No Drugs, No Alcohol\n  \nJust because you&#8217;re off road doesn&#8217;t mean these rules don&#8217;t apply.\n\n6. Avoid Wearing Headphones\n  \nIf you keep your hearing free of obstruction, you can steer clear of any dangerous situations that may arise. You&#8217;ll also be alert to anyone else who may be in trouble.\n\n7. Be Prepared Ahead of Time\n  \nCheck the weather forecast for day you&#8217;re heading out the dunes; nothing can ruin your fun as much as getting stuck in wet sand. While you&#8217;re at it, be sure to get a map of the area you&#8217;re planning to visit to avoid getting lost. Lastly, a first aid kit always comes in handy, though we hope you never need it!\n\nReady to hit the dunes? You&#8217;ll be needing a Dune Buggy or ATV first! Luckily, a href=\"http://ridetheoregondunes.com/\" target=\"_blank\"Spinreel Dune Buggy and ATV Rental/a has everything you&#8217;d need to head out for a day of sand duning!\n\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-90829\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SandBoarding-674x452.jpg\" alt=\"SandBoarding\" width=\"674\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SandBoarding-674x452.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SandBoarding-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SandBoarding-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SandBoarding.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n\nOf course, riding sand dunes isn&#8217;t limited to four wheels!  Ask any sandboarder and they&#8217;ll tell you that the most fun you can have on a dune takes place on a board.\n\nSandboarding Tips\n\n1. Head to the Middle\n  \nYou may ask &8220;middle of what&#8221;? We mean to the middle of the dunes, away from grass and trees. Boarding by grass can damage it, which in turn can have negative effects on the sand dunes themselves.\n\n2. Dry Sand Good, Wet Sand Bad\n  \nSo here&#8217;s the thing about wet sand. It sticks to your board, which could lead to a wipe out. Stick to dry sand and you&#8217;ll be in good shape.\n\n3. Wear a Snowboard Helmet\n  \nSure, the dunes you&#8217;ll be boarding down are made up of soft sand, but there&#8217;s always the chance to hit a hard surface. Wear a helmet and keep yourself safe!\n\n4. Wear Sunscreen\n  \nYou&#8217;ll be in the sun for a while so you&#8217;ll certainly be needing sunscreen.\n\n5. Expect the Same as Snowboarding&#8230; But Different\n  \nIf you&#8217;re a snowboarder, then chances are you&#8217;ll pick up sandboarding very quickly. Just don&#8217;t expect it to be exactly the same as snowboarding. Take a moment when you&#8217;re starting out to get a feel for the difference between sand and snow.\n\nSo there you have it, all that&#8217;s left  is to find some dunes to practice is on. And with a href=\"http://www.stateparks.com/oregondunes.html\" target=\"blank\"Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area/a just a short drive away, you&#8217;ll be riding the sand in no time!\n\nphoto credit: sandboarding via photopin (license)",

        "content": "Did you know that Fall is one of the BEST times to visit the Oregon Coast?\n\nIn case you haven&8217;Autumn is so lovely in fact, many of our locals refer to it as the Oregon Coast&#8217;s &#8220;Second Summer&#8221;. A few of the perks of traveling to the Oregon Coast during the fall season include:\n\nWeather\n\nDuring the autumn months, visitors can still find plenty of sunny days along with average highs in the upper 60&8217;s and sometimes low 70&#8217;s.\n\nSmaller Crowds\n\nSince the crowds are usually smaller during this time, it&8217;s a great time to do some early holiday shopping in our unique shops and antique stores. There is usually very little (if any) wait time to get a table in your favorite restaurant, and visitors often find the beaches almost to themselves at times!\n\nGreat Hotel Deals\n\nSince lodging prices tend to drop after Labor Day Weekend, why not take advantage? a href=\"/deals/\" target=\"_blank\"Click here/a to find some of the best deals.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_520\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"size-full wp-image-520\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/photo2.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Credit: Joe Drew  from &quot;Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston&quot;\" width=\"600\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/photo2.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/08/photo2-553x443.jpg 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Photo Credit: Joe Drew from &8220;Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston&#8221;\n  /p\n/div\n\nInspired to give it a try? We&#8217;ve put together a list of some of our most popular activities to help you plan your &#8220;Second Summer Getaway&#8221;.\n\nExplore our Beaches\n\nWe have the most diverse options on the Oregon Coast. Go beachcombing, picnicking, or tidepooling. Some of our favorite local beaches include Bastendorff Beach, Cape Arago State Park, Lighthouse Beach, Horsfall Beach hore Acres State Park & Simpson Beach, and of course [Sunset Bay State Park ](/listings/sunset-bay-state-park/ \"Sunset bay state park\").\n\n Discover our Roots\n\nWith a rich background in timber and fishing, there’s lots of history to explore. A favorite is always Cape Arago Lighthouse and Self Guided Historic Walking Tours. Be sure to take a stroll along the Coos Bay Boardwalk in Downtown Coos Bay and explore our rich maritime history at the newly opened a href=\"http://cooshistory.org/\" target=\"_blank\"Coos History Museum & Maritime Collection/a on N. Front St.\n\nHiking & Biking Trails\n\nDozens of hiking and biking trails will take you through the forest, mountains and cities or along rivers and coast. Favorites include the Oregon Coast Trail (Sunset Bay to Cape Arago), four miles of trails winding along one of the most spectacular coastlines in Oregon.\n\nAdventure seekers also enjoy exploring the Bluebill Trail. Located off Horsfall Road in the Oregon National Recreation Area, this trail loops around a seasonal lake which is home to different species of birds and aquatic animals. Bring your camera and binoculars to view the sights.\n\nWe should also note a trip to the a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/south-slough-national-estuary/\" target=\"_blank\"South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve/a is always a treat. This local gem offers outdoor lovers 9,000 acres and offers hiking trails for all ability levels.\n\n Fishing and Crabbing\n\nIf it&#8217;s a fishing adventure you&#8217;re after, you&#8217;ll be happy to know that there are over 30 lakes and rivers to choose from in Coos County. There’s fish for every season and an endless choice of prime fishing spots to select from.\n\nNo trip to the Adventure Coast is complete without Dungeness crab, and the best crab are always the ones you bring up yourself from the waters of lower Coos Bay. Our local fishing expert, Gary Vonderohe from the a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/\" target=\"_blank\"Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife/a says that crabbing has been very good the past couple of weeks and should continue to get better. &#8220;This is the best crabbing I’ve seen in several years,&#8221; he says.\n\nRental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores often rent and sell rings and also at the locations below:\n\nFishermen’s Wharf (Get your Crabbies Cooked and Cleaned!)\n  \nFishermen’s Wharf is located on D-Dock in the beautiful Charleston Boat Basin. It’s the red, white, and blue floating building across from the Basin Tackle Shop and Sea Basket Restaurant. Fishermen’s Wharf sells fresh local crabs and fish caught by our local Charleston fishing fleet. Crab ring rental packages are now available! Come down and check out what’s in the huge live tank or stop by and have the crabs you caught cooked. Call for hours of operation (541) 888-TUNA (8862). a href=\"http://www.fishermenswharforegon.com/\" target=\"_blank\"www.fishermenswharforegon.com/a\n\nCrab Shack\n  \n63840 Crossline Road, Charleston, OR 97420\n  \n(541) 888-3433\n  \nOpen daily from 8am-6pm\n  \nCrab rentals, bait, and cooking and cleaning available.\n\nDavey Jones Locker\n  \nCape Arago Highway & Boat Basin Road\n  \nCharleston, OR 97420\n  \n(541) 888-3941\n  \nCrab ring rentals, supplies, licenses, market, food and deli. Call any time for updated crabbing conditions.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? If you can&#8217;t get enough of summer, it&#8217;s time to take a road trip to Oregon&#8217;s Southern coast!\n",

Nowadays, there are more tools than ever for aspiring photographers to capture and share their favorite moments right on their mobile devices. Whether you are a seasoned professional or an a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/travelcoosbay/\" target=\"_blank\"Instagram /aaddict, Oregon&8217;s South Coast offers a variety of stunning natural backgrounds to create unforgettable images.\n\n&#8220;Winter Storm Watching&#8221; season will soon be here, giving nature lovers a chance to photograph the mighty Pacific in all it&#8217;s glory. We have a number of a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/2014/10/dramatic-winter-storm-watching-on-the-oregon-coast/\" target=\"blank\"Tips for Winter Storm Watching/a for visitors to read. A couple of months ago, we came up with a list of a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/2016/08/grab-the-camera-top-spots-for-aspiring-photographers/\" target=\"blank\"Six Places Aspiring Photographers Must See on Oregon&#8217;s South Coast/a.\n\nimg class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Oregon-Coast-Winter-Storm-Watching.png\" alt=\"Oregon Coast Winter Storm Watching\" /\n\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-93953\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cape-Aargo-Loop-674x443.png\" alt=\"Oregon Coast Photographs\" width=\"674\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cape-Aargo-Loop-674x443.png 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cape-Aargo-Loop-254x168.png 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cape-Aargo-Loop-120x80.png 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cape-Aargo-Loop.png 1034w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n\nWhile there are numerous places to capture an iconic Oregon Coast shot, there are several destinations you may not have thought to visit. We asked our local experts to share some of their favorite photography spots you may not have known about.\n\nOne of the tips we received was from a a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\"Facebook fan/a was very specific. &#8220;Pull into parking area of the old newspaper building on 101, right on the bay,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Just wait 5 minutes, and you will see something awesome. The first thing I ever saw from there was a huge flock of egrets on the water. You never know what you will see from there.&#8221; Another fan suggests photographing &#8220;The bay itself. The little nooks and beaches tucked in along Empire make you fall in love with Coos Bay.&#8221;\n\nIf you are really devoted to getting the perfect shot, another visitor suggests going all in and camping out for it at spots like a href=\"http://highwaywestvacations.com/properties/oceanside\" target=\"_blank\"Oceanside Beachfront RV Resort/a. &#8220;Their beach cove is stunning, she says. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to stay overnight just rent a campsite for the day. You won&#8217;t regret it.&#8221; Several of you suggested the U.S. Coast Guard Station located at 63450 Kingfisher Rd in Coos Bay. &#8220;I always include the Coast Guard Look Out and walk around the area for photo opps,&#8221; says a local.\n\nPhoto opps can be found everywhere in our area, you just have to keep your eyes open. It also helps to get an early start. As one local expert advised, &#8220;Even just around the general Coos Bay/Coquille/Charleston areas, early morning fog gives beautiful scenery&#8221;.\n\nHere are some other photo friendly places our locals recommend, Do you have any to add?\n\nh4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\n  Bastendorf beach, the hill above it looking at the entrance to the bay;br / Shore Acres at Christmas timebr / Empire Lakesbr / Gold Beachbr / The Hollering Placebr / The Trails at Cape Arago State Parkbr / Empire Lakes Trailsbr / Sunset Beachbr / Coos Bay Boardwalkbr / Saunders Lake\n/h4\n\nIf you are headed to the beach, watch for dangerous sneaker waves, especially this time of year! NEVER turn your back to the ocean and don’t climb on beach logs.\n\nWe love seeing your photographs! Tag your photo with a href=\"http://https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/travelcoosbay/\" target=\"blank\" class=\"brokenlink\"TravelCoosBay/a on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram so we can see and share!\n",

It might surprise you, but   for the last 5 decades, CAM has been an important piece of our state’s cultural landscape providing countless opportunities for the extraordinary artists living in our region.\n\nThe museum is located inside a historic 1936 Art Deco US Federal Building in downtown Coos Bay and offers a wide range of arts activities including exhibitions, art classes and lectures. Hours are 10:00am to 4:00pm, Tuesday through Friday and 1:00 to 4:00 pm on Saturday. Museum admission: $5 general, $2 students, veterans and seniors, free to Museum members.\n\nIf you are visiting Oregon&#8217;s South Coast this winter, be sure to add this hidden cultural gem to your itinerary, you&#8217;ll be glad you did! Here is a run down of their current exhibits visitors are invited to check out this winter.\n\nWorks from Coos Art Museum&#8217;s Permanent Collection: People and Prints\n\nThe museum is currently featuring a large exhibition of selected works from its Permanent Collection through February 4, 2017.  “Permanent Collection: People and Prints” focuses on two areas within Coos Art Museum’s Permanent Collection – portraits and figures, and fine art prints.\n\nMany newly acquired works will be on display for the first time at the Museum and this will be an opportunity to savor the breadth of the Permanent Collection which now includes over 595 works. Many of the works are by well-known local artists such as Gan Martin, while others are by artists with an international reputation such as the Englishmen Henry Moore and Lynn Chadwick.\n\nCoos Art Museum’s fine art print collection is broad containing styles from abstract works such as “Constellations” by the New York artist Howardena Pindell to an Art Nouveau inspired figure by the Czech artist Dagmar Mezricky.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_94702\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-94702 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fish-Monger-Coos-Art-Museum-674x624.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled (fish monger) by Stan Fullerton\" width=\"674\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fish-Monger-Coos-Art-Museum-674x624.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fish-Monger-Coos-Art-Museum-144x133.jpg 144w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fish-Monger-Coos-Art-Museum.jpg 926w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Untitled (fish monger) by Stan Fullerton\n  /p\n/div\n\n&nbsp;\n\nInternationally known artist Robert Kipniss is featured at Coos Art Museum\n  \nThe Coos Art Museum is hosting a solo exhibition by the internationally acclaimed fine art printmaker Robert Kipniss through February 4, 2017.  The exhibition takes place in the Museum’s Perkins Gallery and features prints in three different media, dry point, lithography and mezzotint. The exhibition also includes examples of the artist’s preliminary drawings and the copper printing plates.\n\nLow Tide Landscapes Photos Exhibition\n\nThe Museum is also hosting Low Tide Landscapes, a juried exhibit of images by members of the Willamette Valley PhotoArts Guild, through February 11, 2017. Juror Julia Bradshaw, associate professor of art at Oregon State University, selected photographs by 15 members of the group to make up the exhibit, which explores the unusual and often alien terrain that is exposed along the Oregon Coast during low tides, particularly during extreme minus tides that occur in the spring and summer. Each of the photographers in the show has his or her own photographic style and work in a wide range of photographic media, including pinhole, iPhone, infrared, aerial and platinum, as well as straight and manipulated digital photography.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_94706\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"wp-image-94706 size-large\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Coos-Bay-Tidal-Flat-by-Bob-Ross-Coos-Bay-Art-Museum1-674x448.jpg\" alt=\"coos-bay-tidal-flat-by-bob-ross-coos-bay-art-museum\" width=\"674\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Coos-Bay-Tidal-Flat-by-Bob-Ross-Coos-Bay-Art-Museum1-674x448.jpg 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Coos-Bay-Tidal-Flat-by-Bob-Ross-Coos-Bay-Art-Museum1-200x133.jpg 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Coos-Bay-Tidal-Flat-by-Bob-Ross-Coos-Bay-Art-Museum1-254x168.jpg 254w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Coos-Bay-Tidal-Flat-by-Bob-Ross-Coos-Bay-Art-Museum1-120x80.jpg 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Coos-Bay-Tidal-Flat-by-Bob-Ross-Coos-Bay-Art-Museum1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Coos Bay Tidal Flat by Bob Ross\n  /p\n/div\n\nExhibition of porcelain sculpture by Elena Karina Canavier\n\nA show of porcelain sculptures by the late Elena Karina Canavier is on display through February 11, 2017.

When the outdoors beckon, it&#8217;s time to embark on a beach stroll, a hike through the woods or along the  a href=\"/trip-ideas/guide-to-the-oregon-dunes-national-recreation-area/\" target=\"blank\"Oregon Dunes/a or one of our beautiful state parks. Perhaps you&#8217;ll want to go for a drive along the a href=\"/trip-ideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/\" target=\"blank\"The Cape Arago Beach Loop/a, go winter fishing, crabbing, clamming, biking, ANYTHING to get you outside!\n\nBut as you know, winter weather on Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast can change at the drop of a hat. So what does one do on those days when the outdoors don&#8217;t seem quite as appealing? Here are ten ways to have a great time while staying out of the cold:\n\n1- Catch a Movie at The Egyptian Theatre\n\nThe beautifully restored and historic Egyptian features classic movies and live entertainment throughout the year.

Photo by Rob Collier\n  /p\n/div\n\nWhere are the best places for my pets to play?\n\nUnless otherwise specified, keep your pet on a leash in public areas. However, if your pup needs a good run, we recommend heading to a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/horsfall-beach/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Horsfall Beach/a in North Bend and a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/bastendorff-beach/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Bastendorff Beach /ain Charleston. Both locations have long stretches of beach for dogs to run and play.  As an added bonus, dogs are allowed off leash provided they are well behaved and must be under owner’s control at all times.\n\nNever, EVER leave your dog unattended. Even the most well-trained dog can get distracted; pay extra special attention to your surroundings and any potential situations that may cause your dog to wander or run off.\n\nIn addition to beach walks, the majority of our hiking trails are also super pet friendly.  Make sure you bring plenty of water for your furry friend (rule of thumb is 1 quart of water for your dog for every three miles you plan to hike). Travel Oregon has some great tips for travelers and their four legged friends. Read a href=\"http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/oregon-stories/tails-trails-hiking-the-coast-with-a-dog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Tails & Trails: Hiking the Coast with a Dog/a if a hiking trip is part of your itinerary.\n\nOh, and this should go without saying, but please ALWAYS pick up after your pet! We like to keep our beaches and hiking trails clean and beautiful for all to enjoy.\n\n What about dining out?\n\nThere are some local restaurants like the a id=\"link-448\" href=\"http://www.blueheronbistro.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Blue Heron Bistro/a that allow pets on the patio. We recommend calling ahead and finding out what options are available for your four legged friend.\n\nAre there reliable pet sitting services available?\n\nFor the adventures that you can’t bring your pet along, there are a number of pet sitting services who can help out! Please keep in mind you should check in advance with care providers to see what pet records are required.\n\n  Carol’s Pet Sitting 541-297-6039\n  Morgan Veterinary 541-269-5846\n  Riverview Kennels (in Bandon) 541-347-4689\n\n What about overnight accommodations?\n\nWe also have a number of Pet Friendly a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"lodging/a options here on Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast (call ahead of time to confirm in case their policy has changed).  You can also check with Pet Travel sites like a href=\"https://www.bringfido.com/destination/city/coosbayorus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"www.bringfido.com/a for info.\n\nBest Western Plus Holiday Hotel\n  \n411 N.

        "content": "With such of range of prime fishing spots, it&#8217;s no wonder Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area is an angler&#8217;s dream come true! Between the bay, ocean and 30+ lakes and rivers, you&#8217;re all but guaranteed to enjoy a fishing trip worth bragging about this spring and summer. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to help you plan the ultimate fishing adventure this spring!\n\nStep One: Decide what kind of fishing adventure you’re looking for.\n\nSo you prefer saltwater fishing or freshwater fishing (we have plenty of both). Crabbing & Clamming? a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/2017/02/where-can-i-find-the-best-kayak-fishing-on-oregons-adventure-coast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Kayak fishing/a? Deciding on the type of fish you want to catch will play a huge factor in where you are going to fish. For instance, if it’s Chinook Salmon you’re after this spring, you will want to embark on a deep sea fishing excursion in the Pacific.\n\nIf you’re looking for trout, you’re best bet will be to stick to the lakes (which have recently been stocked with trout).\n\nIs it Surfperch you want? You’ll want to hit one of our beaches like Bastendorff Beach, Horsfall Beach and Cape Arago State Park.\n\nWant to go digging for clams? Clamming is excellent during low tides near Charleston, off Cape Arago Highway, and Clam Island. There are also good places to dig clams even on positive low tides in Coos Bay.\n\nAs you can see, there are numerous options to choose from!\n\n Step two: Once you have an idea on what you want to catch, do some quick research!\n\nWe strongly recommend checking current fishing conditions by going to a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/RR/southwest/#fishing\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife&#8217;s website/a. Visitors will also find excellent tips and recommendations by calling local businesses like a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/basintacklecharleston/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Basin Tackle Shop/a and a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/bites-on-bait-and-tackle-coos-bay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Bite&#8217;s On Bait & Tackle/a. Their employees are known to be a friendly and helpful resource for anyone that needs fishing, clamming, or crabbing tips and gear and current information.\n\nStep Three: Map out your adventure.\n\nAfter doing a bit of research, you’ll have a good idea of where you will want to go. Fishing suggestions for this spring include\n\n  Bass – Coquille River\n  Largemouth Bass – Bradley Lake, Butterfield Lake, Eel Lake, Empire Lakes, Hall Lake, Powers Park Pond, Saunders Lake, Tenmile Lakes.\n  Chinook Salmon (Spring) – Pacific Ocean.\n  Surfperch – Coos Bay, Bastendorff Beach, Horsfall Beach, Cape Arago State Park\n  Cutthroat Trout – Note: Trout season in streams and rivers opens span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog80746845\"span class=\"aQJ\"May 22nd/span/span. _ Bradley Lake, Coquille River (east fork), Coquille River (middle fork), Coquille River (north fork), Coquille River (south fork), Eel Lake, Hall Lake, Millicoma River (east fork), Millicoma River (west fork), New River, Shuttpelz Lake, Tenmile Lakes, Tioga Creek.\n  Rainbow Trout – Note: Rainbow trout are stocked into the lakes and the lakes are open all year. Bluebill Lake, Bradley Lake, Butterfield Lake, Eel Lake, Empire Lakes, Sru Lake, Powers Park Pond, Saunders Lake, Tenmile Lakes.\n  Sea Run Cutthroat Trout – Note: Trout season in streams and rivers opens span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog80746845\"span class=\"aQJ\"May 22nd/span/span. _Coos River, Coos River (south fork), Coquille River (north fork), Millicoma River.\n  Yellow Perch – Empire Lakes, Saunders Lake, Tenmile Lakes\n\nClick here for more information.\n\n Step Four: Get an Oregon fishing license!\n\nA fishing license is required for those age 12 years or older. Daily licenses are available. Most fishing charters, bait shops and sporting goods stores can supply these for you. You can purchase a fishing license locally in stores like Bi-Mart, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Fred Myer, the ODFW Office (licenses only) in Charleston and Walmart.  Click here to see the fishing license requirement.\n\nStep Four: Make arrangements.\n\nThere are a number of resources to help you with your accommodations. Camping options as well as a href=\"http://www.rvparkreviews.com/regions/oregon/coos-bay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"RV parks/a and hotels to choose from.\n\n Step Five: Pack accordingly.\n\nThe weather changes often so pack accordingly. Layers are key! No matter what season, be sure to pack a jacket, long pants and sweaters. Other essentials include: windbreaker, sunscreen, lip balm, wide-brimmed hat, Polarized sunglasses, waterproof jacket and rain pants, bug spray, small first aid kit, hand sanitizer and/or wipes, backpack, collapsible cooler, reusable drinking bottle, waterproof bag&#8230;gosh, we could devote an entire blog post to this subject alone!\n\nFollow these five steps and you&#8217;ll be well on your way!\n",

        "content": "preemPhoto Courtesy of a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/portofcoosbay/?hl=en\"Port of Coos Bay/a/em/pre\n\nWith spring now gracing Oregon&#8217;s adventure coast, it&#8217;s the ideal time to head out on the water and take part in one of Coos Bay&#8217;s most renowned activities: fishing. We&#8217;ve offered a href=\"/2017/03/how-to-plan-your-oregon-coast-spring-fishing-trip/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"tips/a and a href=\"/2017/02/where-can-i-find-the-best-kayak-fishing-on-oregons-adventure-coast/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"locations/a to help you spend a terrific day fishing; now it&#8217;s time to offer a bit more detail on what you should pack for your Oregon fishing adventure.\n\n✔ Layered Clothing\n\nIt&8217;s best to assume fluctuating weather; anticipate cold weather when making an early morning departure, but be prepared for direct sunlight once the sun comes out. It&#8217;s also important to remember that even the warmest of days can experience a big drop in temperature when offshore. Layered clothing allows you to adjust for changes in temperature accordingly. Be sure that part of your layer clothing includes a waterproof jacket and rain pants.\n\n✔ Gloves\n\nNot only will gloves protect you from both sunburn and cold temperatures associated with the previous tip, they will protect you from line cuts.\n\n ✔ A Hat\n\nA hat is paramount when sitting out on the water in the direct sunlight. Be sure to bring a wide brimmed hat, a baseball hat, or anything else that will provide some shade. Additionally, a hat can help keep you warm on those cold days.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_94649\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  img class=\"size-large wp-image-94649\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Travelcoosbay10-674x509.png\" alt=\"“Fishing, Crabbing, Clamming…we got it all at the Charleston Marina!” Photo by @portofcoosbay\" width=\"674\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Travelcoosbay10-674x509.png 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Travelcoosbay10-176x133.png 176w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Travelcoosbay10.png 807w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" /\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    “Fishing, Crabbing, Clamming…we got it all at the Charleston Marina!” Photo by @portofcoosbay\n  /p\n/div\n\n✔ Sunscreen\n\nBe sure to have sunscreen on hand and apply generously every few hours. Even on overcast days, you can get a sunburn!\n\n ✔ Polarized Sunglasses\n\nThere are many good reasons to have a pair of polarized sunglasses: they give relief from direct sunlight; they can protect your eyes from sharp hooks; they allow you better visibility of fish and your line. A good pair of sunglasses is worth the investment.\n\n✔ Rubber soled shoes\n\nYou&8217;ll want to bring rubber soled shoes to prevent skidding; it can get slippery out on the boat!\n\n✔ Reusable Water Bottle\n\nFishing can be a strenuous activity—more so on a hot sunny day. Stay hydrated with a drink on hand. A good quality reusable water bottle will prevent leaks or damage should it bounce around on the boat.\n\n ✔ First Aid Kit With Seasickness Medication\n\nAs cuts and scrapes are a possibility whenever fishing, a good first aid kit is essential. The kit should include band aids, antiseptic cream, hand sanitize, and seasickness medication.\n\n✔ Life Jacket\n\nIt’s the law to have a life jacket (that fits) for each person on board of any boat.\n\n ✔ Camera\n\nWhen you finally land that epic catch, you&#8217;ll no doubt want to snap a picture or two to share. A camera/phone will come in handy, just be sure to store it in a&#8230;\n\n✔ Waterproof Bag\n\nBring a waterproof ziplock and/or other sealable bag to hold your electronics and valuables.\n\n ✔ Cooler\n\nIf you&#8217;re bringing drinks or snacks with you, a cooler will be invaluable. Fill it with some ice and you&#8217;re good to go!\n\n✔ Fishing License\n\nAn Oregon fishing license is required for those age 12 years or older._  Most fishing charters, bait shops and sporting goods stores can supply these for you. Visit our a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/travelers-guide/fishing-license-requirements/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Fishing License/a page for more information. Note: there are eight free fishing days in 2018. There dates are February 17-18, June 2-3, Sept 1-2, Nov 23-24_._\n\nWith these items packed, you&8217;re ensured to have a productive—and safe—day of fishing, all that&#8217;s left is to go out there and catch some fish!\n",

        "content": " ### “Oregon State Parks often make great family beach trips easy, safe, and fun. Sunset Bay is no exception. The grounds are well-kept and the cove protects swimmers and beachgoers from wind and high waves. Great for picnics, playing on the beach, and wading in the water.” &#8211;Recent Review on TripAdvisor\n\nCamping on the Oregon Coast has always been a favorite among travelers from all over the Pacific Northwest, especially during the spring and summer months. Though there is no shortage fabulous camping sites in our region, Sunset Bay State Park is one of the most consistently recommended camping destinations among families traveling with children.\n\nSunset Bay State Park is one of three Oregon State Parks along the Cape Arago Highway, which runs along the Pacific Ocean west of U.S. Route 101. It’s calm, crescent shaped beach and kid friendly tide pools are just a 10 minute walk from the camping sites and very popular with families, couples, kayakers, paddle boarders, picnickers, hikers and everyone in between.\n\n“The bay was gorgeous and a great little hangout on the beach for the kids,” writes a recent guest. “Waves were pretty mild so the kids could play in the water without worrying about the current”.\n\n“The beach here is great. It is in a protected cove so the surf is calm,” says this recent visitor from Austin, Texas. It&#8217;s easy for young toddlers to wade in, or take out a kayak or stand up paddle board.”\n\nThe campground has sites for tent camping and RV&#8217;s, as well as cozy and comfortable yurts. Day-use and picnic facilities are located along the bay to allow easy access for beach combing, fishing, swimming, and boating. A network of hiking trails connects Sunset Bay State Park with nearby Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks. These beautiful and well maintained trails take hikers on a journey through pristine coastal forests and offer spectacular views of the Pacific ocean, seasonal wildflowers and the Cape Arago lighthouse.\n\nIn addition to the amenities mentioned above, the park’s desirable location is a very popular feature, especially those who are traveling with kids.  The park is located on Cape Arago Hwy, one of the most scenic areas on the Oregon coast and just a short distance of several &#8220;must see&#8221; attractions like Simpson&#8217;s Reef, the Cape Arago Lighthouse, Shore Acres State Park, Cape Arago State Park and many more. It’s a wonderful place to get away and appreciate a quiet, natural setting yet the towns of Charleston, North Bend and Coos Bay are a short drive away. “Secluded yet close to the urban life,” writes another recent visitor. “So quiet you can hear the sea lions and surf. Beautiful rain forest like park”.\n\nOne recent traveler discovered it by accident to break up the drive between Nehalem Bay State Park and Avenue of the Giants. “I couldn&#8217;t have been more pleasantly surprised. This place is a GEM! The cool shaped rock formations at the head of the bay act as a natural breakwater which calms the otherwise fierce Oregon ocean and makes for a pretty chill afternoon at the beach. At low tide there&#8217;s tide pools to check out and when the tide rolls in it&#8217;s suitable for swimming and calm enough for paddle-boarding. There are trails leading out of the park that travel along the coast which are a must see. Steep cliffs and dramatic rock formations are only a couple of minutes hike….This is one of my new favorite spots and can&#8217;t wait to come back.”\n\n“The bay is absolutely stunning,” says another recent visitor. “The live-in staff and park rangers are very helpful and hospitable. The facilities are clean and well maintained.”\n\nWhether you&#8217;re looking for a place to camp for the week or a great spot to spend a day, Sunset Bay State Park  is an experience worth having. This summer, come discover the beautiful natural gems inside this popular destination.

This short drive is the perfect way to have the quintessential Oregon Coast experience with stunning beaches, state parks, spectacular scenery along with the alluring sounds of waves crashing and sea lions barking.\n\nThe Cape Arago Lighthouse near Charleston, Oregon is one of the iconic sites travelers will see along the way and is visible from multiple vista points. It is one of the most photographed lighthouses on the West Coast and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The history of the Cape Arago Lighthouse goes back to 1866 when Coos Bay was one of the most active harbors on the West Coast and there was a need for a lighthouse to guide ships carrying lumber and coal into our bay.\n\nThough images of The Cape Arago Lighthouse are posted everywhere, the lighthouse itself remains a mystery to many. It is no longer in operation nor is it open to the public.  And yet, it still has a commanding presence and simple beauty making it the star of photographs and journals from travelers from around the world! The lighthouse stands on Chief&#8217;s Island at Point Gregory but visitors are no longer allowed on the island and is now private property.\n\ndiv id=\"attachment_95273\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\n  a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51801-d548010-r333914800-CapeAragoLighthouse-Charleston_Oregon.html#photos;geo=51801&detail=548010&ff=260215236&albumViewMode=hero&aggregationId=101&albumid=101&baseMediaId=260215236&thumbnailMinWidth=50&cnt=30&offset=-1&filter=7\"img class=\"size-large wp-image-95273\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-2017-07-19-at-1.58.05-PM-674x597.png\" alt=\"Cape Arago Lighthouse\" width=\"674\" height=\"597\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-2017-07-19-at-1.58.05-PM-674x597.png 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-2017-07-19-at-1.58.05-PM-150x133.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-2017-07-19-at-1.58.05-PM.png 688w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" //a\n  \n  p class=\"wp-caption-text\"\n    Photo courtesy of TripAdvisor.

        "content": "North Bend Oregon may very well be the best kept secret on the Oregon Coast. Situated on the north bend of the Coos Bay (hence its namesake) this gem of a community is home to beautiful beaches, eclectic stores, antique shops, music, theatre, friendly locals, nightlife, restaurants, majestic sand dunes, the historic McCullough Memorial Bridge and much much more.\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-95340\" src=\"http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/north-bend-674x448.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"674\" height=\"448\" /\n\nNorth Bend's unique history and culture gives it an undeniable charm that has appealed to travelers for decades. The town is also home to the Oregon Coast’s only airport, the a href=\"http://flyoth.com/\"Southwest Oregon Regional Airport/a (airport code: OTH), the largest enclosed shopping mall on the Oregon Coast, a href=\"http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/pony-village-mall/\"Pony Village Mall/a in addition to a href=\"http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/horsfall-beach/\"Horsfall Beach/a and the North Spit, named as one of Sunset Magazine’s top ten beach strolls in the western region.\n\nHere are a few ways to unwind and spend a lovely day (or two) in our treasured community of North Bend, Oregon.\nh3Morning/h3\nBegin by fueling up your day with a hearty breakfast at the a href=\"http://www.pancakemill.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Pancake Mill Restaurant and Pie Shoppe /a on Tremont Street, HWY 101. Make sure you get there early, this spot is very popular with locals and visitors alike!\n\nAfter feasting on an epic breakfast, head to the a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/guide-to-the-oregon-dunes-national-recreation-area/\"Oregon National Dunes Recreational Area/a for your first adventure of the day! Most of the ATV/dune buggies rental places open around 10 a.m. so you should have time for a quick morning hike before taking on the thrill of riding across massive tracks of sand, through forests and onto the beach! Local businesses like Spinreel Dune Buggy &amp; ATV Rentals, Inc, Steve’s ATV Rental and Doon Bugs offer Dune Buggy &amp; ATV rental and instruction. Call ahead to confirm hours and availability. Be sure to dress in layers, the weather is always changing.\nh3Lunchtime/h3\nCall it a hunch, but you'll probably work up an appetite during your adventure on the sand dunes. Fortunately, North Bend has no shortage of fantastic lunch spots. Captain’s Choice Family Fish House on Virginia Avenue is a great spot for seafood, fish ‘n chips and chowder. Yeong's Place is very popular among locals for their fantastic burgers and friendly service. The Plank House Restaurant inside The Mill Casino serves up a fabulous crabcake sandwich and offers gorgeous views of the bay. a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/eat-drink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Visit our Eat &amp; Drink/a section to see more ideas.\nh3Early Afternoon/h3\nAfter a delicious lunch, be sure to hit Sherman &amp; Virginia Avenues for an afternoon shopping and strolling in North Bend's “old town” district. You'll definitely want to hit Painted Zebra Designs, Fat Cat Antiques and Beauty &amp; the Beast Antiques. Take a left on Virginia Ave and experience the North Bend Boardwalk and visit and view our bay framed in forested hills. Take a right on Virginia and you will be headed for the largest covered mall on the Oregon coast, a href=\"http://ponyvm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Pony Village Mall/a. If there is anything you may need you can probably find it here. Major as well as small local businesses abound in this gathering place.\nh3Mid-Late Afternoon/h3\nTime to hit Books by the Bay, another favorite among locals. Browse for a good read from their selection of new and used books. If you need a \"pick-me-up\", head to Human Bean for drive-thru espresso, coffee, tea, smoothies &amp; kid-friendly beverages.\n\nIf there is time, we also recommend grabbing your camera (if you already haven't) and checking out the lovely views of the historic McCullough Memorial Bridge from Ferry Rd Park or walk along the a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/north-spit-overlook-wetland-trail/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"North Spit Overlook/a and check out the wildlife.\nh3Early Evening/h3\nFor your evening itinerary, you can't beat a neighborhood dining experience at a locally owned restaurant like Ciccarelli's or Hilltop House Restaurant and Lounge overlooking the water. After dinner, hit the Mill Casino and take your chances with lady luck on their massive selection of Vegas style slots and table games.\nh3Late Evening/h3\nWarehouse 101, located inside the Mill Casino, is a fun destination for live music, comedy, watching the game or just hanging out with a brew or two. If you're in the mood for a something different, get your tickets in advance for one of the live musical, drama, comedy or variety show performances at LTOB/Little Theatre on the Bay at The Liberty Theatre. For those who want a laid back, local community vibe, The Back Alley Pub &amp; Grill at North Bend Lanes on Virginia Avenue is another popular spot for casual dining, microbrews, a full bar and cosmic bowling! The Liberty Pub on Sherman Ave is another hot local spot to catch a game, have a brew or take in some live music.\n\nHope you enjoyed this sample itinerary!

        "content": "It's well known fact that the state parks found along the the a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Cape Arago Beach Loop /a are nothing short of grand, but if there is one destination along the way you cannot miss, it is the glorious gardens of a href=\"http://shoreacres.net/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Shore Acres State Park/a , a.k.a. \"the jewel of the South Coast”.\n\nPerched high above the Pacific on rugged sandstone cliffs, Shore Acres features lush gardens with plants and flowers from all over the world. \"This is, without question, Oregon's most beautiful state park,\" writes Terry Richard for a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/travel/index.ssf/2015/05/shorteacresinspringoregons.html\"The Oregonian/a. \"Well, maybe you can question that statement, though the gardens are the most spectacular man-created feature in the state park system in my book.\"\nh3\"A Garden for All Seasons\"/h3\nBecause there is something blooming every season, Oregon coast visitors enjoy discovering unique flowers, plants, evergreen shrubs and trees (including the largest Monterey Pine in Oregon) in this manicured \"garden for all seasons\". We can’t get enough of the stunning dahlias in the fall, hundreds of rhododendrons and azaleas in the early spring, thousands of daffodils, tulips through late spring and summer and over 800 blooming rose bushes throughout the summer months. emNote: Bloom times are based on normal/average conditions at Shore Acres and may vary./em\n\nVolunteers painstakingly install more than 300,000 holiday lights (almost all L.E.D.) in the fall to bring dazzling Pacific themed visions to life.  Thousands of eager visitors make their way to Shore Acres to view the annual a href=\"http://shoreacres.net/holiday-lights/\"Holiday Lights at Shore Acres/a display (Nov. 23 thru Dec. 31, 2017). Shore Acres's all-seasons garden is made possible by an army of dedicated a href=\"http://shoreacres.net/about-us/about-friends-of-shore-acres-inc/\"Friends of Shore Acres/a volunteers.\nh3\"From Private Estate to One of Oregon's Most Beloved State Parks\"/h3\nWhat began as a luxurious private estate that belonged to lumber and shipping tycoon, Louis Simpson, has become a beloved local treasure for anyone to enjoy. The original plantings of Shore Acres were designed to take advantage of the mild climate and featured exotic trees, shrubs, and flowering plants brought in from around the world.\n\nThe ornate grounds on Mr. Simpson's estate complemented his opulent home featuring (among other luxuries) a heated, indoor swimming pool and a large ballroom. The original estate included five acres of formal gardens along with a Japanese-style garden built around a 100-foot lily pond that remains today.\n\nIn 1942, Simpson’s estate was purchased by the state of Oregon for use as a public park. Today, a fully enclosed observation building offering ocean vistas and protection from the weather is located where Simpson's elegant mansion once stood. The observation building has interpretive panels describing the history of the Simpson estate.\nh3\"The Jewel of the South Coast\"/h3\nIn addition to exploring the gardens, visitors can take in spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean along with towering waves crashing against the shoreline and cliffs. Whale watchers have ample opportunities to spot migrating whales during the winter and summer migrating seasons. A secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach awaits those willing to hike down a trail.\n\nstrongMore Info/strong\nShore Acres State Park is located on the Cape Arago Highway, 13 miles southwest of Coos Bay/North Bend and U. S. Highway 101. Parking is $5 per car. Admission to the park is free. Please checka href=\"http://shoreacres.net/\" shoreacres.net/a for seasonal hours and events.  If you have questions, please talk to a member of the garden staff or call (541) 888-3732.\n",

Nowhere is salmon art more evident than in the Pacific Northwest, where the salmon has been the source of life and sometimes controversy for hundreds of years. Juror, Dr. Deana Dartt former Curator of Native American Art at the Portland Art Museum and current Scholar-in-Residence at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, New Mexico has selected sixty stunning works of art to represent the range of salmon themed art today.\n\n[gallery size=\"medium\" ids=\"95417,95418,95419\"]\n\nThe exhibition will open with a free public reception on Friday October 13th from 5 to 7pm.

This is certainly one of our favorite local holiday traditions and it has captured the attention of media, residents,and visitors from all over the country.\n\nThis festive annual display debuts on Thanksgiving Day (Thursday, November 23rd) and will light up Shore Acres from 4 p.m.-9:30 p.m. each night (including Dec 24th &amp; 25th) thru December 31st, 2017.\n\nThe tradition began back in 1987 when a group came together and decided to “string a few lights” to help celebrate the holidays. That first season, 6,000 miniature lights, one large Christmas tree, and the decorated and open Garden House drew 9,000 visitors.\n\nWho knew this would one day bloom into one of the most anticipated holiday events on the Oregon Coast featuring 325,000 dazzling lights (both LED and landscape), thirty Christmas trees, dozens of lighted sculptures, performance pavilion, and a festive open house\n\nBring the whole family and delight in the site of illuminated sea animals, birds, flowers, ships and more. Visitors can also enjoy hot cider, punch, coffee and cookies served in the Garden House with friends.\n\nThis magical display is made possible by Friends of Shore Acres, an estimated 1500 volunteers, the park staff and the financial support of local businesses, the community and the visitors who attend each season. Shore Acres State Park is famous for its beautiful 7 acre botanical gardens, Japanese lily pond, and Garden House- and the holiday light display is nothing less than stunning.\n\nFor more information and directions visit a href=\"http://www.shoreacres.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"www.shoreacres.net /aor call Shore Acres for more information 541-888-3732.

        "content": "Oregon's Adventure Coast features a relaxed and rustic atmosphere ideal for anyone seeking refuge from the hustle and bustle of the \"real world\". Charleston is known for its charming marina, fishing, friendly merchants, beautiful beaches and a distinctly charismatic local community.\n\nHere are some of our favorite recommendations we have for visitors to our area.\n\n1.Visit the 6,000-square-foot a href=\"http://www.charlestonmarinelifecenter.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Charleston Marine Life Center/a, located on the campus of a href=\"http://oimb.uoregon.edu/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"UO's Institute of Marine Biology/a. The museum features permanent exhibits including a Marine Ecosystem Gallery, an Underwater Oregon Gallery (where after just a few minutes exploring, you're likely to see a multitude of marine life you may have never known existed) and an Oregon Fisheries Gallery (an open-air deck where visitors can see fishing vessels coming and going from the harbor). Visit a href=\"http://oimb.uoregon.edu/cmlc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"oimb.uoregon.edu/a for more info.\n\nGrab some Fish ’n Chips ata href=\"https://www.millersatthecove.rocks/\" Miller’s at the Cove/a or award-winning chowder at a href=\"http://hightidecafeoregon.com/\"High Tide Cafe/a. You'll also enjoy exploring what's fresh in the retail fish markets (there are four, including one floating market on the docks in the marina). They can ship fresh seafood or you can purchase the canned catches from Charleston.\nGo for a stroll along the a href=\"http://www.portofcoosbay.com/marinahome/\"Charleston Marina Complex/a. Charleston is home to a marina and boatyard that support thriving commercial and recreational fleets. With nearly 200 commercial fishing boats and 250 or so recreational boats, the docks and boatyard are busy year-round. Our fishermen bring in fresh Oregon Dungeness crab and pink shrimp, both officially sustainable seafood fisheries.\nSpend an afternoon at the a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve Interpretive Center/a learning about our local culture, history and natural resources. There are also miles of beautiful hiking trails and waterways to explore in addition to classes/workshops for all ages.\nSpend a day exploring the Cape Arago Highway Beaches and State Parks along the a href=\"http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/itineraries/2-cape-arago-beach-loop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Cape Arago Highway/a:\n\nul\n\n \tliTake a walk and watch the surfers on a href=\"http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/bastendorff-beach/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Bastendorff Beach/a or search for natural treasures in tidepools in the protected beach in a href=\"http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dspparkPage&amp;parkId=70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Sunset Bay State Park/a./li\n\n \tliDon't miss the holiday lights and all-seasons garden at a href=\"http://www.shoreacres.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Shore Acres State Park/a (also one of the a href=\"https://whalespoken.wordpress.com/\"emWhale/em Watching emSpoken Here/em® /a sites December 27th-31st)./li\n\n \tliBe sure to look for sea lions, harbor seals, and occasional elephant seals in the viewing area overlooking a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/shell-island/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Shell Island/a./li\n\n \tliFrom the overlook head south to the end of the roadway at a href=\"http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dspparkPage&amp;parkId=66\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Cape Arago State Park/a. This is a prime place to view migrating California gray whales. And watch for black oystercatchers and other birds feeding in the sea spray along the rocks. On a clear day, you can see for miles north and south./li\n\n/ul\n\nGo on a fishing adventure! While trips are limited in the winter due to weather conditions, it’s worth checking with a href=\"http://www.bettykaycharters.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Betty Kay /aand a href=\"http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/pacific-charter-services/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Pacific Charters/a about opportunities to get out on the water.\nExplore the eclectic shops in Charleston.  You'll never know what you'll find in our unique shops throughout Charleston.

        "content": "It may be the middle of winter, but we don't mind. Whether you like to catch them yourself or just eat them, February is a perfect time to go crabbing on the Southern Oregon Coast! Now that commercial crab season is finally here, a fresh Dungeness crab meal is waiting for you! Why not be adventurous and catch this delicacy yourself in the waters of lower Coos Bay?\n\nMany seasoned crabbers will tell you the general rule of thumb is to plan a crabbing excursion during a month with an ‘r’ (January, February, March, etc). As an added bonus, Mother Nature tends to sprinkle in a handful of wonderfully warm and sunny days during this time which makes crabbing even better!\n\nh3If you'd like to try catching them yourself, we've got some tips for you to follow! /h3\n\nCatching your own Dungeness crab might sound intimidating, but it is not as hard you think and something everyone should try at least once!  It can be done by renting or buying a crab ring and with a little help from the stronga href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife/a/strong.\n\niframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YD6axpWSIA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/iframe\n\nstrongHere are some helpful crabbing tips for beginners:/strong\n\nh3Crabbing Tip #1/h3\n\nRent crab pots and crab rings. Rental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores. In addition to rentals, many of these local businesses can supply bait, information on the latest conditions and some will even cook and clean your catch for a reasonable price!\n\nstrongBasin Tackle Shop/strong\n\n63510 Kingfisher Rd, Coos Bay. 541-888-3811\n\nstrongBites – On Tackle/strong\n\n750 Newmark Ave, Coos Bay. 541-888-4015\n\nstrongFisherman's Wharf/strong\n\nD-Dock in the Charleston Boat Basin. 541-888-TUNA (8862)\n\nstrongDavey Jones Locker /strong\n\nCape Arago Highway &amp; Boat Basin Road Charleston, OR 97420\n\n(541) 888-3941\n\nh3Crabbing Tip #2/h3\n\nIn addition to pots or rings, make sure you have the following supplies (most can be rented at the businesses mentioned above)\n\n✓ Crab measuring tool\n\n✓ Bait holders and bait supply\n\n✓ Cooler\n\n✓ Gloves\n\nh3Crabbing Tip #3/h3\n\nSlack water (the time around high or low tide) are the best times to crab. During slack water, crabs are generally walking around and foraging since they are not getting pushed around by tidal exchange.\n\nh3Crabbing Tip #4/h3\n\nAn Oregon fishing license is required for those age 12 years or older (except during one “free fishing weekend” in June when licenses or tags are NOT required). Daily licenses available.

However, if you’re using the crab ring the fish heads also attract the big guys like seals and sea lions (you don’t want as they’ll steal your bait). Some locals suggest using chicken or turkey when using an open crab ring. You’ll still attract the crabs, but the pesky sea lions will leave it alone.\n\nh3 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"Crabbing Tip #8/h3\n\nCheck with the a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife/a for the most current shellfish regulations and harvest notices.\n\nFor more tips, visit the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and be sure to read their a href=\"http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/docs/CrabbingFlyer.pdf \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"stronginstructional flyer How to Crab/strong /a.\n",

Clamming is appealing to many Oregonians and visitors because it is relatively easy and the reward is a tasty treat best served in chowder, steamed or fried. There are no special skills required, no expensive equipment, and beginners can usually pick it up quite easily.\n\nThe low tides commonly found from Empire to Charleston make our region one of the top destinations for clam digging.

The 16-panel exhibition documents 250 years of Native peoples’ contributions in U.S. military history. \"Native Americans have served in every major U.S. military encounter from the Revolutionary War to today’s conflicts in the Middle East in higher numbers per capita than any other ethnic group,\" the museum said in a statement.\n\n“Tens of thousands of Native Americans joined the U.S. armed forces during World Wars I and II,” said Herman J. Viola, curator emeritus of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History and curator of “Patriot Nations.” “Forty-four thousand Native Americans served in World War II; the entire population of Native Americans was less than 350,000 at the time. They are Purple Heart recipients and Bronze Star medal honorees. Many have been recognized with the Congressional Medal of Honor, the United States’ highest military award.”\n\nPatriot Nations also calls attention to the creation of the National Native American Veterans Memorial on the grounds of the museum on the National Mall. Congress has charged the museum with building the memorial to give “all Americans the opportunity to learn of the proud and courageous tradition of service of Native Americans in the Armed Forces of the United States.” Working together with the National Congress of American Indian, Native American veterans, tribal leaders, historians and cultural experts, the museum will complete the memorial by Veteran’s Day 2020. For more information about the memorial, visit the website at: a href=\"https://nmai.si.edu/nnavm/\"AmericanIndian.si.edu/NNAVM/a.\n\nPatriot Nations: Native Americans in Our Nation’s Armed Forces remains on view through April 29, 2018, at the Coos History Museum, 1210 North Front Street, in Coos Bay. The exhibition was produced by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian and made possible by the generous support of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians.\n\nstrongAbout the Coos History Museum:/strong\n\nThe Coos History Museum, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, is dedicated to preserving the history of Coos County and Oregon’s South Coast, past and present.

Guests of the a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"visitor center/a frequently tell us how pleasantly surprised they are about the quality of the food, service and the selection of our local dining establishments. Guess you could say it's one of the best-kept secrets on Oregon's Adventure Coast!\n\nWe're also earning a reputation for hosting some of the most delicious festivals on the coast like the upcoming annual a href=\"/events/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"BBQ, Blues &amp; Brews by the Bay/a May 25th-27th, the a href=\"/event/the-mill-casino-food-truck-off/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Mill Casino Food Truck Off/a August 3rd-5th,the annual a href=\"/event/annual-charleston-seafood-festival/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Charleston Seafood Festival/a August 10th-12th and many others throughout the year.\n\nWhether you're in the mood for local fresh seafood, comfort food, burgers, sushi, ethnic or pub fare- you will find it here. Most of our restaurants are locally owned and operated and are active members of the community. Many restaurant owners and staff will often chat with travelers, welcoming them and giving them an authentic sense of the history and culture in our area as well as unique ideas to get the most out of their trip.\n\nIt's exciting to see new additions to our growing restaurant scene, so here are a few you'll enjoy checking out on your next visit.\n\na href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Friends-Cafe-530179044034503/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"h2Friends Café/h2\n\n/a\n\nAs the name suggests, this community-oriented café offers friendly service along with classic American fare, burgers and sandwiches, salads, and wraps. “Come in as strangers and leave as friends. We want everybody who comes in here to have a great time, enjoy our food, and we welcome feedback,” says co-owner Debra Robertson in aa href=\"http://theworldlink.com/news/local/business/friends-cafe-to-open-in-eastside-by-the-end-of/article480369f0-211a-5df0-89fe-e9961fc3f69b.html\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" recent World News article/a. We've heard many positive reviews about this new spot from happy guests who recommend the fish and chips, Southfork Melt, homemade clam chowder and the Cross Road Chicken Sandwich.\n\na href=\"https://www.facebook.com/The-Boat-1658642967582777/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"h2The Boat/h2\n\n/a\n\nThere's a saying that goes “what is old is new again\" and that is certainly the case with this new Coos Bay addition. Fans of the popular floating restaurant, Unger's in Winchester Bay, will be happy to know that the restaurant has a new name and new location. The Boat (formerly Ungers) relocated next to the Railroad Museum on U.S. Highway 101 in Coos Bay just a few months ago and it's getting rave reviews. The building itself was originally a houseboat that has been converted into a restaurant with a large, new, dog-friendly deck for outside. The menu features the signature fish and chips made famous at Ungers along with delicious seafood platters, burgers, salads, chowder bread bowls and much more.\n\na href=\"https://nosterkitchen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"h2Noster Kitchen/h2\n\n/a\n\nFor travelers with food sensitivities or just looking for wholesome, healthier options, finding the right restaurant can be a challenge! Fortunately for us, Noster Kitchen opened in downtown Coos Bay recently and has proven to be a popular spot for breakfast and lunch. The menu is full of delicious meals and can accommodate special dietary needs including gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, vegetarian, vegan, paleo and more! Their lunch bowls are a hit with carnivores and vegans alike and all menu items are cooked from scratch using minimally processed ingredients and local, seasonal produce. \"Finally fresh clean eating in Coos Bay,\" says this Google Local Guide. \"Dog-friendly seating, too! Had the nori bowl and it was so flavorful, fresh and fast. Enjoyed sitting outside on the enclosed patio. Very attentive and friendly service. Can't wait to go back. Definitely, a place that can be Whole30 and Paleo friendly.\"\n\na href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RestaurantO/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"h2Restaurant O/h2\n\n/a\n\nThere is no need to travel to a large city for a fine dining experience. Perhaps one of the most exciting recent additions to the local restaurant scene is Restaurant O, led by Master a href=\"http://restauranto.us/masterchef-o-neill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Chef Eoghain O’Neill/a. Even though Restaurant O has only been open for a few months, Chef O'Neill's fresh new menu and attentive staff have already received widespread accolades from visitors and locals alike. Located in the space formerly occupied by Benetti's Italian Restaurant, Restaurant O is one of the first open concept kitchens in southern Oregon and features a tapas and cocktail bar, a brasserie main dining hall and a tasting room on the upper level that overlooks the bay. Reservations are recommended.\n\nSo when you visit our area this spring and summer, be sure to bring your appetite!

Taking a tour with one of their guides this summer is an excellent way to experience the natural beauty of the south coast like never before.\n\nThough there are a number of fun-filled tours to choose from along the peaceful waterways and wild rivers up and down the coast, we've got our spotlight on the tours out of Coos Bay and Bandon, Oregon. Here are some options to consider:\n\nh2ba href=\"https://www.southcoasttours.net/tours/kayak-south-slough-coos-bay/\"South Slough Coos Bay Wildlife Viewing Kayak Tour/a with South Coast Tours/b/h2\n\nThe South Slough of the Coos River is home to the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve which is a protected area of land and estuary. There are many birds that utilize this beautiful area such as Bald Eagles, Osprey, Great Blue Herons, Egrets and Belted Kingfishers. The tides are great in this estuary so we will plan to ride the ebbing and flowing tides to make this paddle a little easier. There are also Harbor Seals and Brown Pelicans making for a fun wildlife viewing tour. Total distance is about 4.6 miles over 2.5 hours.\n\na href=\"https://www.southcoasttours.net/tours/kayak-south-slough-coos-bay/\" target=\"_blank\"\n\n/a\n\nh2a href=\"https://www.southcoasttours.net/tours/kayak-bandon-coquille-river-tour/\"Bandon Coquille River Tour/a/h2\n\na href=\"https://www.southcoasttours.net/tours/kayak-bandon-coquille-river-tour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n\n/a Bandon Coquille River Tour: Paddle the Coquille river and explore the Bandon Marsh U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Reserve, the historic high docks, shipwrecks and Native American fishing weirs.

You're about to embark on a very special journey. Follow these tips to help you get ready to face your next race head on!\n\nh3#1 Find the Right Training Plan and Stick to It!/h3\n\nFailing to prepare is preparing to fail!  It takes time to get into running shape, so it's critical to follow a training plan that is right for you! Since most of the running events on Oregon's South Coast have multiple hills and trails, you will want to incorporate that into your training. A simple online search will bring you hundreds of viable training programs, though many new runners have found the a href=\"http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51122/10K-Novice-Training-Program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Hal Higdon Training Programs/a to be easy to follow. You may want to consider finding a training partner to run with you. You're more likely to stick to your program if you are accountable to someone.  Depending on where you live, local running groups like our a href=\"http://www.southcoastrunningclub.org/\"South Coast Running Club/a are a great place to find like-minded runners. Simply ask around to find a friend or neighbor who is up for the challenge.\n\nh3#2 Book Your Accommodations Early/h3\n\nTo run a good race, you must get a good night's sleep the night before and a place to rest and recover post-race. With just a couple of months to go until the a href=\"http://prefontainerun.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Prefontaine Memorial Run/a and a href=\"https://www.charlestonsalmonrun.com/\"Charleston Salmon Run/a, we strongly advise that you visit our a href=\"/lodging/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Lodging Page/a and book your accommodations asap!\n\nh3#3 Invest in the Right Running Attire/h3\n\nThe wrong socks, shoes and running attire will result in more blisters and chafing. Avoid wearing cotton since it has a tendency to trap in sweat. Look for breathable, moisture-wicking material and dress in layers. Oregon weather can change quickly! Do some research and invest in quality running shoes or else you risk injury due to improper footwear. If possible, head to a store for runners and ask the associate to help you find the right shoe and the right fit for you. If that's not an option, there are dozens of tips and guidelines you can find online.\n\nh3#4 Learn The Route/h3\n\nIf possible, preview the route where the run will take place. Familiarity will help you avoid any surprises come race time and allow your body to adjust to the course. If you can't train in person at the location, study it online to get a good feeling for what type of race it will be. Runners can preview the a href=\"http://prefontainerun.com/run-info/course-map.php\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"course map for the Prefontaine Memorial Run/a in addition to the a href=\"https://www.active.com/coos-bay-or/running/distance-running-races/charleston-salmon-run-and-crab-walk-sponsored-by-advanced-health-2018#js-map\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"Charleston Salmon Run course/a.

Visitors and locals will have a special opportunity to spot them as they pass the Oregon Coast. Even though the peak travel time is in March, migrating whales can be spotted off our coast well into the summer months.\n\nA family trip to the Oregon Coast during Whale Watching Week is the perfect way to spend Spring Break. Hundreds of a href=\"http://www.whalespoken.org/\"Whale Watching Spoken Here®/a volunteers will be available from 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. at 26 whale-watching locations along on the coast the week of March 23rd - 31st, 2019. These trained volunteers will help visitors spot the migrating whales and other marine life along our coast and learn more about them.\n\n{{ floatimage src=\"img/Whale Watching Oregon Coast.jpeg\" float=\"right\" alt=\"Your Alt Text goes here\" size=\"40\" }}\n\nIt's estimated that 18,000-plus gray whales now live in the eastern north Pacific area. An average of six (6) whales per hour migrate past the Oregon coast during the peak northbound migration, but that return trip is spread over four months. About 200 of these whales drop off the migration route and feed along the Oregon coast all summer.\n\nThough the Oregon Coast offers many spectacular viewing spots, a href=\"http://www.shoreacres.net/\"Shore Acres State Park/a, located 15 miles southwest of Coos Bay, is perhaps one of our favorites. a href=\"https://whalespoken.wordpress.com/best-places/\"Use this map/a to help plan your next whale watching trip.

        "content": "National Estuaries Week (NEW) is happening THIS WEEK (September 14th-21st) and we wanted to take the opportunity to help raise awareness for these precious water systems and spotlight our own local estuary and local gem, The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (South Slough NERR)!\n\nMany do not realize the important role that estuaries have in our ecosystem and in our lives. Estuarine ecosystems serve as natural barriers to buffer against storms and floods, absorb and store carbon, and provide critical habitat for commercial and recreational fisheries. The need to protect and restore these critical places has never been more pressing.\n\nIf you haven’t had the opportunity to visit South Slough NERR, we urge you to do so! This 5,000-acre natural area located in the Coos estuary on the south coast of Oregon is perfect for families, hikers, kayakers, wild-life watchers and everyone in between. \n\nSouth Slough encompasses a mixture of open water channels, tidal and freshwater wetlands, riparian areas, and forested uplands and the Interpretive Center is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 am until 4:30 pm (Closed on State holidays). Trails are open from dawn to dusk every day. Many of their educational and outdoor programs are free or offered at a low cost to cover materials. South Slough NERR is located 4 miles south of Charleston on Seven Devils Road.\n\nCurious about the importance of our nation’s estuaries? Here are some answers to a few of the FAQs:\n\nWhat is an estuary? An estuary is a partially enclosed body of water along the coast where freshwater from rivers and streams meets and mixes with saltwater from the ocean. Estuaries are an irreplaceable natural resource that must be managed carefully for the mutual benefit of all who enjoy and depend on them.\n\nWhy are they important? Estuarine environments are among the most productive on earth, creating more organic matter each year than comparably-sized areas of forest, grassland, or agricultural land. The tidal, sheltered waters of estuaries also support unique communities of plants and animals especially adapted for life at the margin of the sea. Thousands of species of birds, mammals, fish, and other wildlife depend on estuarine habitats as places to live, feed, and reproduce. Many marine organisms, including most commercially-important species of fish and crab, depend on estuaries at some point during their development. Source: www.water.epa.gov\n\nAre there estuarine environments on Oregon’s South Coast? Yes. The South Slough NERR is located in Charleston Oregon. This 5,000-acre natural area is a place like no other. It encompasses a mixture of open water channels, tidal and freshwater wetlands, riparian areas, forested uplands and open water habitats.\n\nWhat kind of activities are available here? There are many ways to enjoy the South Slough. Taking an educational class, guided birding, kayaking, attending a native plant workshop, hiking the trails, viewing of the marsh or visiting the Interpretive Center art gallery and seeing works of local painters are just a few of the activities you will find here.\n\nAre there any local events we can participate in? Yes. Stand UP! For the Bay is an event taking place on National Estuaries Day, Saturday, September 28th, 2019 from 9 am to 1:00 pm in downtown Coos Bay. Meet on the boardwalk (across from Visitor Center). Participants will either stand up paddle, canoe, or kayak, in the bay along a route that is designed for ease of travel, with consideration of tide and wind direction. This event includes education activities, food/drink, live music, and a paddle joust event. Click here for more information. \n\nYou can also spend the day at South Slough NERR, located at 61907 Seven Devils Road Charleston, OR 97420. Go to www.oregon.gov or call (541) 888-5558 for info.\n\nWhat is National Estuaries Week? National Estuaries Week (NEW) is an annual event that encourages the public to learn more about our estuaries. Many take advantage of volunteer opportunities and hands-on restoration in their local bay or estuary, participate in a guided walk or boat tour, or simply explore your estuary with family and friends.\n\nTo learn more about National Estuaries Week September 14-21, 2019 and ways to help support your local estuaries like South Slough NEER, please visit estuaries.org.",

        "content": "The Pacific Ocean is filled with a vibrant array of marine life and rich ecosystems. Those of us who live here or are visiting Oregon's South Coast are very fortunate to have such extraordinary access to these precious natural habitats and curiosities. It's no wonder this area is an epicenter for everyone from marine biologists to the naturally curious.\n\nOne of our most prized hidden gems is the Charleston Marine Life Center, part of the OIMB - The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology. From the outside, you'd never know that a wealth of knowledge about the Oregon Coast and it's mysterious ocean life is available to all. It's nearly impossible to visit the exhibits and not learn something new.\n\nThe 6,000-square-foot marine center was recently described by one visitor as \"A modest looking building, but when you walk thru the entrance it is an 'OMG' experience...There are amazing and highly informative exhibits of marine life including everything from 'whales to snails' and everything in between...Lots of hands on projects for kids 9-90! This place is amazing - a treasure - go out of your way to see !!\"\n\nMuch of the success of the Charleston Marine Life Center should be credited to amazing work done by its volunteers and a dedicated staff led by Trish Mace, the former Manager of Ocean Education at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. Read what other visitors have been saying:\n\n \"This marine centre was highly recommended in our travel magazine. We paid $4 each (AAA rate) and spent about an hour touring both floors. The knowledgeable volunteers answered our questions and provided us with plenty of additional information. The starfish exhibit was great. The shell display upstairs is impressive. Take time to read all the informational boards. The whale skeletons hanging from the central ceiling were interesting. This is a great place to learn more about the local sea creatures.\" - Google Review, March 2019\n\n \"This Marine Life Center is part museum, part small aquarium. It is right on the marina overlooking the water. There are live animals in tanks and lots of skeletons and preserved specimens. The exhibits include touching various aquatic animals and looking at specimens under microscopes. It is small and inexpensive but young kids have fun and learn about what is in the water outside the windows.\" --TripAdvisor, October 2018\n\n This is a little gem of an aquarium. The displays are informative, very understandable and well done. There is something interesting for every age level, and we all learned some new things about Oregon marine life. The volunteers there are friendly and knowledgeable, too. Well worth the small price of admission! - TripAdvisor June 2018\n\n \"Fantastic space and beautifully done. All the kids were engaged with the exhibits and the staff were excellent about answering their questions!\" - Facebook, April 2018\n\n \"What a hidden gem! Went on my daughter's field trip. Touch pool for kids, whale n turtle skeletons plus more. Variety of objects to touch n look under microscope n magnifying glass. Just awesome.\"- Google Review, March 2019\n\n \"Loved it, great for both kids and adults! Small, intimate and with tons of knowledge!\"- Google Review, March 2019\n\n \"Such an interesting place. So many things to see! We could've spent the whole day, but didn't have it. Will return to do it justice one day. Loved the touching pond, the many, many shells, the whale skeleton parts, etc.\" Google Review, Jan 2019\n\nThe Marine Life Center features different exhibits that include:\n\nA 13-foot skull of a humpback whale in addition to marine specimens collected by university researchers dating back 50 years.\nUnderwater Oregon Gallery, an exhibit where visitors can select dive sites and see the incredible marine life found in deep waters off of Oregon by using a touch screen. Just spend a few minutes exploring and you’re guaranteed to see a multitude of marine life you may have never known existed.\nMarine Ecosystem Gallery, an aquarium gallery filled with aquatic life from the surrounding area. It even includes a shallow touch tank may (gently!) handle starfish, hermit crabs, and more.\nThe Oregon Fisheries Gallery, an open-air deck where visitors can look and see fishing vessels coming and going from the harbor, as well as unloading their latest catch. The real star of the Oregon Fisheries Gallery is the interactive display panels that will inform visitors of fishing equipment, commercially important species of fish, and the role marine life has played with ancient cultures.\nThe Marine Mammal Gallery, home to the complete skeletons of a 23-foot long orca and a 35-foot long California grey whale, as well as skulls and bones of smaller whales, sea otters, and seals. Furthermore, visitors can look out through the large windows to harbor seals and sea lions.\n\nReady to plan your visit? The Charleston Marine Life Center is open Wednesday - Saturday from 11 am – 5 pm and located at 63466 Boat Basin Rd. Charleston, OR 97420.

With nearly 200 commercial fishing boats and 250 or so recreational boats, the docks and boatyard are busy year-round. Our fishermen bring in fresh Oregon Dungeness crab and pink shrimp, both officially sustainable seafood fisheries.

        "content": "Are you craving an Oregon Coast adventure? Whether you’ve been to our area before or you’re planning your first trip, we have an activity or two to add to your bucket list. Let’s talk Oregon Coast crabbing and clamming. No trip to Oregon’s Adventure Coast is complete without a fresh Dungeness crab or clam feast from the waters of lower Coos Bay.\n\nThe best-tasting crabs and clams are the ones you catch yourself. It takes a little planning and patience, but the payoff will be a fresh meal you’ll always remember. If you’re ready to be adventurous and catch your own, you will need to follow these tips for crabbing and clamming success!\n\nFive Tips for Oregon Coast Crabbing & Clamming Success\n\nGet your license. A shellfish license is required to go crabbing or clamming here on the Oregon Coast. Three-day licenses can be obtained in advance at local ODFW offices and at many sporting goods or hardware stores.\nDress appropriately. It doesn’t matter what season it is, it can get chilly out there! Dress in layers that can get dirty and wear waterproof boots, especially if you are clamming.\nGet the proper gear. Most of the necessary equipment for your crabbing or clamming adventure can be rented at many local RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores. For crabbing, you will need to rent crab pots and crab rings along with bait, a gauge to measure the crabs, a cooler and gloves. For good old fashioned Oregon Coast clamming outing, you will need a bucket, a clam-digging shovel and/or a tube a.k.a. a “clam gun” (these can also be rented).\nAsk the experts. In addition to equipment, many of our local bait and tackle stores will provide instruction and helpful tips for first-timers and beginners. Our bait and tackle stores are also great resources to get valuable information on the latest conditions. They can tell you when the best time of day to go crabbing or where to dig for clams based on the tides and the season.\n\n5. Familiarize yourself with current rules and regulations. Be sure you have a firm understanding on what you can keep and what you’ll need to throw back into the water. These regulations exist for environmental reasons and to sustain the crab and marine life population. For Oregon Coast crabbing, only male crabs larger than 5 ¾ inches can be kept. You’ll be able to recognize the females by their short abdominal flaps. If you are clamming on the Oregon Coast, you are allowed 20 bay clams per day in the aggregate, however, only 12 may be Gaper or Empire clams. Check with your local bait and marine store or click here for ODFW’s Regulations Summary for Marine Shellfish.\n\n The Best Time to Visit\n\nIf an Oregon coast crabbing adventure is at the top of your list, plan to visit during months ending in the letter “r”. October, November, and December are the months when you’ll likely have the best luck with crabbing. For Oregon coast clamming, you’ll want to visit when there’s a low tide. The best time of year for that during the summer months of May, June, or July/\n\nBuy It Fresh and Local\n\nAs wonderful as Oregon Coast crabbing and clamming is, we understand that catching or digging up dinner for yourself isn’t for everyone. In this seafood loving region, there are several places fresh seafood retailers like Chuck’s Seafood, Fishermen's Wharf and Fishermen's Seafood Market where you can pick up fresh crab and clams that have been cleaned and are ready to take home! Trust us, you won’t be disappointed.",

The series of events celebrates the very best of Oregon's South Coast including world-class biking trails like the Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trails and the Wild Rivers Coast Scenic Bikeways.\n\nWhether you are a seasoned cyclist or a casual rider, we encourage you to bring your bikes to the first-ever Live Culture Coast to enjoy the many options here ranging from flat surfaces to heart-pumping hills and trails. Here are some ideas and resources to help you plan Oregon's Adventure Coast for an epic cycling adventure this fall, or any time of the year.\n\nFUN FOR MOUNTAIN BIKERS\n\nWhiskey Run Mountain Biking Trails.  \nThis local gem of a trail system flows and winds through the misty Coos County Forest on cross-country style trails. Mountain bikers of all levels enjoy the easy to moderate climbs and thrilling descents.\n\niframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA0X_rpH930\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\nbrOther local destinations for avid mountain bikers to explore include-\n\nBLUE RIDGE LOOP\nWINCHESTER NORTH\nEMPIRE LAKES\nEUPHORIA RIDGE TRAILS\n\nFUN OPTIONS FOR ROAD CYCLISTS\n\nThe Oregon Coast Bike Route (PDF).  \nFollowing along US Highway 101, the Oregon Coast Bike Route attracts thousands of bicyclists. Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston is one of the areas where cyclists depart from the main highway and take a scenic detour along the rugged coastline on Cape Arago Loop and 7 Devils Road. Click here for the North Bend to Bandon Oregon Coast Trail Map.\n\nCity Bike Riding Trails Map (PDF).  \nOur friends at the Front Street Community Bike Works have put together a wonderful resource of cycling trail maps from no hills to daredevil!\n\nFAT BIKING DESTINATIONS\n\nOne of the newest additions to the cycling world that we can't get enough of is the Fat Bike. What is a fat bike you might ask? Think of it as an off-road bicycle with oversized tires, typically 3.8 in or larger and wider rims designed to ride in softer terrain, like sand, snow, and mud.\n\nSo grab your bike and bring it down for a ride along the miles of Horsfall Beach and into The Dunes for a challenging experience. As Katy Bryce put it in her article, Fat Biking 100 Miles of Oregon Coast, “Riding fat bikes is not just beach cruising! The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area provided us with the opportunity to shred hard in soft sand. Hike up. Slide down. Giggle. Repeat.” Beware of sneaker waves and stay off rocks and small, enclosed beaches. Please be respectful and do not touch the wildlife nor the sensitive micro-environments you encounter.\n\nAbout Live Culture Coast  \nLive Culture Coast (October 18–27, 2019) is a menu 90-plus hands-on experiences celebrating art, food, nature and adventure. Hosted by the makers, creators, and entrepreneurs of the Southern Oregon Coast, the experiences take place at shores, trails, farms, towns, restaurants, galleries, and businesses.

        "title": "Eight Ways to Stay Safe on the Beaches Along the Oregon Coast",
        "content": "Following these rules could possibly save your life (or someone else's). PLEASE read and follow these guidelines for your safety and the safety of those around you.\n\nIt’s no secret that the Oregon Coast is a haven for those who love the outdoors. The sight and sounds of majestic Pacific Ocean waves crashing into rugged cliffs is a scene that draws thousands to our area each year. Our quiet, peaceful, undeveloped beaches ideal for long walks and tide-pooling are another feature that attracts curious nature lovers from all over the country to our region. Sadly, if one is not careful, what should be a peaceful day by the sea could suddenly turn deadly without warning. \n\nNow that “storm watching season” is upon us, it’s more important than ever to avoid potential dangers by following these guidelines to keep you and your family safe on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. In addition to these guidelines, most state parks and public beaches will post rules and regulations that are very important to follow. \n\n \\#1-Never Underestimate the Power and Danger of a Sneaker Wave.\n\nOf all the potential hazards, the dangerous sneaker wave can be the most deadly because it is very powerful and comes without warning. Sneaker waves are characterized by a sudden and powerful surge of water that can easily knock you down and drag you into the ocean. Large waves can easily also wash over jetties and rock outcroppings that normally stay dry and protect beach goers. Watch what happens when Steve Raplee, the owner of the High Tide Cafe, was recording the scene at the beach when a sneaker wave came in, sending him and others scrambling for safety. (Video source: The Oregonian courtesy of Steve Raplee )\n\niframe width=\"695\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPypT9dOvSY?start=25\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen/iframe\n\nThe best way to avoid being caught in a powerful and deadly sneaker wave is to never turn your back to the ocean and always keep your eyes on the water.\n\n\\2-Supervise children very closely.\n\nChildren are very adventurous and can quickly find themselves in dangerous situations along the coast if one is not careful. Be extra mindful of their whereabouts at all times and do not let them out of your sight when you are close to the ocean. We do not advise taking young children to the water's edge during storms and other weather events that may make the ocean unpredictable and potentially dangerous. There are numerous spots where you can view the ocean from a safe distance listed at the end of this post.\n\nWe also advise keeping dogs on a leash when you’re close to the water. They too can be vulnerable to powerful sneaker waves and find themselves in danger in a flash. \n\n\\3-Avoid playing or standing on logs.\n\nOur rustic and undeveloped beaches often contain mysterious and beautiful wood formations and logs. While it’s tempting to explore them, we advise that you avoid standing or sitting on them, especially if they are close to the water. Children should never play or climb on the logs. Any wave, regardless of its strength, is capable of lifting the log and can result in serious injury and even tragedy.\n\n\\4 -Beware of the steep cliffs.\n\nHigh and steep cliffs may offer perfect vantage points for viewing the ocean, but be aware that these cliffs often contain sharp and slippery rocks. Make sure that you are wearing protective footgear when on cliffs and keep away from the edges of the cliffs.\n\n\\5 -Beware of the bases of cliffs.\n\nJust like the edges, the bases of the cliffs are equally dangerous. You should mind your head when around such areas as parts of the soil can collapse and hit your head.\n\n\\7- Be Prepared & Be Smart.\n\nCheck the National Weather Service for any severe weather warnings issued along the coast. Wear appropriate foot gear (i.e. athletic shoes or hiking boots) in addition to weatherproof jackets and other attire you can layer to stay warm and protected. Avoid alcoholic drinks or any drug that will affect the normal functioning of the body. It’s always a good idea to let others know of your whereabouts, especially if you are traveling alone. \n\n\\8- Look for the safer areas to experience the coast.\n\nIf you are traveling with young children or animals, or just don’t want to risk it, there are a number of spots on Oregon’s Adventure Coast we can recommend for your safety. Shore Acres State Park has a designated viewing area just for ocean gazers and storm watchers offering magnificent views. On rainy days, there is a storm watching hut to keep visitors safe and dry. A few other great local storm watching spots include the bluff overlooking Bastendorff Beach and Sunset Bay State Park along Cape Arago Highway. Sunset Bay State Park also features a protected beach, with tide pools exposed at low tide. The beach is probably the safest beach to walk on in winter, due to its geography, with land on three sides and an island that slows incoming waves.\n",

        "content": "To truly experience Oregon’s Adventure Coast from local’s point of view, you simply have to get out on the water. There is a range of recreational water activities to choose from here on Oregon’s South Coast. Everything from kayaking to paddleboarding, swimming, scuba diving, surfing and fishing on lakes or with a guide or charter company. But there have not been many opportunities for visitors to get out on the water on a scenic cruise or boat tour to explore Coos Bay's natural beauty and rich history, until now.\n\nCoos Boat Tours is now offering 2-hour scenic and historic tours in Coos Bay. Book a trip for up to 6 passengers on board the Fun Sway, a 40’ Motor Yacht and let Captain Brian Kraynik guide you through the incredible scenic beauty and rich history along the waters of Coos Bay.\n\nbr\n\niframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcaptainkfunsway%2Fposts%2F2228072790616801&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"650\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/iframe\n\nbr\n\nEarlier this month, Travel Writer Rick Dancer live streamed a tour on board the \"Fun Sway\".\n\nbr\n\niframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F110944429810670%2Fvideos%2F1983054142001668%2F&show_text=1&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"470\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"/iframe\n\nbr\n\nDepending on which Coos Bay tour you choose, some highlights include\n\nWatching the hustle and bustle in the Port of Coos Bay and North Bend.\nA unique view of the tug boats, lumber barges, wood chip ships, and a Coast Guard Cutter.\nA close-up view of Coos Bay’s estuary system. \nA trip under the iconic Conde McCullough Bridge.\nA look at Coos Bay’s lesser-seen Eastside industrial waterfront.\nAn unbeatable view of the Isthmus Slough tidal estuary.\n\nRecently, he gave Coos Bay Visitors a special opportunity to view the Tall Ships from a rare perspective!\n\niframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcaptainkfunsway%2Fposts%2F2246909472066466&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"669\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/iframe\n\n \"We went on a two hour tour and the boat ride was very smooth and excellent.

        "content": "The Cape Arago Highway and the Charleston to Bandon tour route are amazing on their own, but when combined, it makes for an inspiring adventure packed with natural wonder and fun along a remote stretch of shoreline here on Oregon’s South Coast. This 41 mile route is a delightful alternative to the Pacific Coast Highway (Highway 101) and will take just about 2-3 hours to drive (depending on the number of stops you make). The drive will lead you past six state parks, two National Wildlife Refuges and America’s first National Estuarine Research Reserve. Travelers of all ages and experience levels will enjoy it as it has everything you could hope to see along the Oregon Coast — iconic views of the Pacific ocean, marine life, sea lions and seabirds, untouched beaches, secret coves and more!\n\n{{ floatimage src=\"/img/charleston-to-bandon-road-trip-route.png\" float=\"right\" alt=\"Charleston to Bandon Tour Route\" size=\"40\" }}\n\nHow Do I Get on the Route?\n\nFrom North Bend, take the Cape Arago Highway to Charleston.  \nWe recommend starting your journey on Newmark Street in North Bend. As you drive west through Coos Bay, it becomes the Cape Arago Highway, leading west until it reaches the fishing town of Charleston where you can make our first recommended stop. The route is well-marked if you are traveling south on Highway 101, just follow the signs to Charleston as the highway passes through downtown North Bend.\n\nStop 1 Charleston Oregon  \nCheck out the Charleston marina where fishing charters and whale watching excursions depart. Take some time to learn something new and explore the Charleston Marine Life Center aquarium. Get to know some of our friendly local merchants like  Kinnee’s Gifts 'N Shells and our friend and fishing expert Rob Gensorek at {{ link url=\"https://www.basintackle.com\" }}Basin Tackle Shop{{ /link }} before grabbing a bite at one of the local seafood restaurants. From Charleston, continue down Cape Arago Highway towards Cape Arago State Park.\n\nStop #2 Sunset Bay State Park  \n{{ link url=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=70\" }}Sunset Bay State Park{{ /link }}, the first of three unique state parks is just a 3 miles down the road. This small, protected cove beach is perfect for tide pooling, picnicking, swimming, kayaking and more. A small parking area just past the park’s campground entrance offers views looking back north to the Cape Arago Lighthouse on Chief’s Island.\n\nStop #3 Shore Acres State Park  \nIt’d be a shame to miss the chance to explore {{ link url=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=68\" }}Shore Acres State Park{{ /link }}, “the jewel of the South Coast”. This magnificent state park was once occupied by lumber baron Louis Simpson’s estate, but today it is visited by thousands of visitors each year for its spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean along with towering waves crashing against the shoreline and cliffs. Whale watchers have ample opportunities to spot migrating whales during the winter and summer migrating seasons. A secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach awaits those willing to hike down a trail. Explore the botanical gardens hidden among the trees. The gardens become a winter wonderland with more than 325,000 LED Holiday Lights from Thanksgiving to New Year’s Eve.\n\nStop #4 Cape Arago State Park  \nThe Cape Arago Highway concludes at the {{ link url=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=66\" }}Cape Arago State Park{{ /link }}. We recommend grabbing your binoculars and taking some time to explore the Simpson Reef and nearby Shell Island to view and listen to the seals and sea lions. Picnic areas offer some of the most beautiful sights along the Oregon Coast.\n\nTo follow the Charleston to Bandon Tour Route, retrace your route northeast on Cape Arago for six miles and turn right on Seven Devils Road. Continue south, and you will find the 5th stop along your journey.\n\nStop #5 South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve  \nThis local natural treasure is home to a variety of marine life, including shellfish, salmon and seabirds. The {{ link url=\"https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx\" }}South Slough National Estuarine Research{{ /link }} offers a number of hiking and paddling trails through estuaries habitat and features an interpretive center.\n\nStop #6 Seven Devils State Recreation Site  \nAnother side trip to your side trip is {{ link url=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=49\" }}Seven Devils State Recreation Site{{ /link }}, where you will find access to several miles of beach popular with agate hunters.\n\nContinue South on Seven Devils Road and eventually you will return to Hwy 101 headed to Bandon.  \nBe on the lookout for the famous cranberry bogs along the way to Bandon (a.k.a. The Cranberry Capital of Oregon) before you hit Stop #7 on the Charleston to Bandon Tour Route.\n\nStop #7-Coquille River Lighthouse  \nThe historic {{ link url=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dspparkPage&parkId=50\" }}Coquille River Lighthouse{{ /link }}, built in 1896, is one of Oregon’s most photographed landmarks. The lighthouse sits at the mouth of the Coquille River which flows between {{ link url=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dspparkPage&parkId=50\" }}Bullards Beach State Park{{ /link }} and {{ link url=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bandon_marsh/\" }}Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge{{ /link }}. Bring your camera!\n\nStop #8-Bandon  \nBandon, a classic beach town, is known for an active art scene, unique stores and restaurants, and beautiful ocean views. Be sure to see the jaw dropping sculptures created from plastic dumped in the ocean at the Washed Ashore gallery and the famous Circles in the Sand labyrinth art ({{ link url=\"https://www.sandypathbandon.com/public-schedule\" }}view the schedule of labyrinth’s here{{ /link }}).\n\nTo learn more and plan your own adventure, order a free {{ link url=\"https://traveloregon.com/travel-guides\" }}Oregon Scenic Byways guide{{ /link }}, or visit our Cape Arago Highway Loop and Charleson to Bandon Tour Route itinerary pages.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n{{ link url=\"https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/trip-ideas/scenic-drives/charleston-to-bandon-tour-route\" }}Travel Oregon: Charleston to Bandon Tour Route{{ /link }}  \n\\\\\n\n{{ link url=\"http://coastexplorermagazine.com/features/best-side-trips-off-oregon-coast-highway-101-page-5\" }}Coast Explorer Magazine: Best Side Trips Off Oregon Coast Highway 101{{ /link }}  \n\\\\\n\n{{ link url=\"https://visittheoregoncoast.com/2018/05/ultimate-south-coast-road-trip\" }}Visit the Oregon Coast: Ultimate South Coast Road Trip{{ /link }}  \n\\\\\n\n{{ link url=\"https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/eat-drink/family-weekend-in-bandon-and-coos-bay\" }}Travel Oregon: Family Weekend in Bandon and Coos Bay{{ /link }}",

        "content": "Five Fun and Funky Places to Stay on Oregon’s Adventure Coast\n\nThere is nothing ordinary about Oregon's South Coast. We have unique people, stores, restaurants, and attractions! Naturally, many of our local lodging establishments will offer Oregon Coast visitors a more eclectic experience than one typically encounters. In this post, we are highlighting a few of the \"funkier\" hotels in our area that will appeal to travelers looking for a more authentic local experience during their travels to Oregon's Adventure Coast.\n\n1- The Itty Bitty Inn\n\nThis funky 1950’s hotel located in North Bend is a local treasure. With just five comfy rooms, this little gem is not your average hotel stay; it’s an experience! Each room is carefully curated to give guests a sense of local beach life, culture and whimsy. Rooms come equipped with locally made soaps, chocolates, coffees, and tea. Guest amenities also include coffee presses, growlers, and glassware for craft brewed treats! One recent visitor described her The Itty Bitty Inn experience with this review:\n\n“Adorable.  If you like shabby chic, this is the place for you!  Each room furnished with a different decade theme, with furnishings and decor from that time period.  My 70's room even had a working Atari video game console!  The owner enthusiastically caters to your comfort and entertainment. But make reservations ahead, there are only 5 rooms.”\n\n2- The Old Tower House Bed & Breakfast\n\nVisitors cannot get enough of this charming B&B located in Coos Bay’s Empire District. This circa-1870s tower-house is the oldest standing structure in Coos Bay and features lovely antiques as well as shabby-chic rooms & apartments. Guests enjoy the friendly service as well as a 4-minute walk to the ocean and proximity to the top local attractions. Read what some of them have written recently about this lovely Coos Bay establishment.\n\n“This B&B is clean, comfortable and managed by a very friendly couple. The coffee was delicious and the breakfast was filling and scrumptious! I stayed one night and felt very safe, welcomed and comfortable!”\n\n“The Old Tower House B&B is the oldest extant structure in Coos Bay, and is run by a friendly couple who have put their heart into the place. Although the rooms are furnished with period pieces, the interior appears to have undergone major renovations.”\n\nPhoto @ The Old Tower House, Coos Bay Bed and Breakfast\n\n3- Coos Bay Manor\n\nBuilt in 1912, this grand colonial-style B&B featuring elegant cozy antiques-filled rooms,  late 19th-century charm, high ceilings, free WiFi & full breakfast is adored by visitors. Guests are treated to a glass of wine upon arrival along with a delicious breakfast the next morning. The Coos Bay Manor is also within walking distance of restaurants and often described by visitors as romantic, timeless, accommodating, comfortable and clean.\n\n“What a wonderful place for a stay,” says a recent visitor. “Exceptionally clean, Very pleasant hosts. Exceptional place for a one night or an extended stay. A free glass of wine if you so desire. You will not be disappointed with your stay”.\n\nPhoto @ Coos Bay Manor Bed and Breakfast\n\n4- Captain John's Motel\n\nPlanning on doing some crabbing, clamming or fishing while you’re here? You can’t go wrong with this no-nonsense motel featuring excellent service, fair prices, convenience, basic but clean rooms and fish-cleaning station among other things! It’s just a 6-minute walk to Charleston Marina Complex, 2 miles from Bastendorff Beach County Park and 3 miles from Sunset Bay State Park.\n\n“Fantastic little hotel in beautiful Charleston,” writes one visitor. “It's very quiet and caters to the fishing crowd, though it's welcoming for anyone. Kitchens are offered and the rooms are basic, clean and warm. The prices are more than fair.” Another guest writes “Not a bad little place. Right on the marina, fish cleaning building, within walking distance of stores, restaurants and the Maritime Museum \\[Charleston Marine Life Center\\]. Basic rooms but very comfortable.” What more can you ask for?\n\nPhoto @ Booking.com\n\n5- The Bay Point Landing\n\nEager to try “glamping”? If you are looking to reconnect with nature, but not quite ready for “roughing it”, The Bay Point Landing might be just the place for you! Nestled on 103 acres sanctuary in Coos Bay, this local gem is a destination for visitors wanting a unique, contemporary camping experience. The park is equipped with modern cabins, RV spots, and Airstreams along with comfortable amenities, adventure, and lovely beachfront views. Experience the outdoors on a whole new level!\n\nOne reviewer writes that “It's a great up and coming place, sets the bar higher for an RV park, all new facilities, big spaces, and almost 0 noise pollution, is currently having work completed on north lot, the south lot is amazing, cool ocean breeze, and smell. If a coastal getaway in your RV is a must, this is the place to go.”\n\nBut wait, there’s more! These unique lodging options are also worth a look!\n\nSouthsider Motel in Coos Bay- Popular no-frills, remodeled and clean single-story motel. “Unexpected gem of Coos Bay! We were driving through town encountering one disappointment after another looking for somewhere to stay. And then we happened upon Southsider. Price was agreeable and the place was simple yet impressive...great host, convenient location, clean, newly renovated, very comfortable...and dogs were allowed. Yay! We couldn’t have been happier. Oh...and there’s a seriously awesome pizza joint, Abby’s Legendary Pizza, just across the street. Stay at Southsider! Just do it!!!”\n\nOceanside Beachfront RV Resort in Charleston- Unwind in unique accommodations such as vintage trailer and airstream rentals, cottages, tents, or in the comfort of your own RV. Enjoy the rejuvenating Oregon Coast with a variety of on-site amenities including a convenient crab shack and complimentary Wi-Fi. Oceanside also allows guests to easily access Oregon beaches where many guests enjoy whale watching or fishing.\n\nCity Center Motel in North Bend -Modern amenities, luxurious accents, and generous hospitality make the City Center Motel a hidden gem nestled into the hub of downtown North Bend, only miles away from downtown Coos Bay and within driving distance of Oregon's beautiful beaches, hiking, sand dunes, OUTDOOR adventures, and local shops and dining.\n\nWhatever kind of accommodations you prefer- whether it's formal, kitschy, professional, funky, vintage, fun, romantic or you just want to be off the grid for a few days, you can probably find it here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. Looking for the right vacation spot is easy as doing a quick online search, but these often overlooked gems sometimes offer the interesting experience you are looking for.

His amazing story and untimely death inspired this challenging (but rewarding) annual run.

From Guns ‘n Roses to Lady Gaga, there’s sure to be a song that’ll put a little “Pre” pep in your step during training runs or the actual race day. Go ahead, get your best running gear, grab some ear buds or a speaker, and run like the wind (a very fast wind – make Pre proud!).

Before your trip, use platforms like the Oregon’s Adventure Coast Facebook  to source suggestions on the best spots to visit, eat, stay and explore. You can also find inspiration by following @travelcoosbay on Instagram & Twitter!  Forums like Reddit are also excellent for finding unique suggestions, especially for travelers with niche interests like antiquing and beer tasting.\n\nWear Sunscreen\nEven on a cold or overcast day, don’t underestimate the strength of the sun. Nothing can put a damper on a trip more than a painful sunburn, especially when you’ll be trekking up and down the coast. Apply sunscreen every day before heading outside, and reapply every hour.\n\nTake Photos of Yourself\nOf course, you should always take that landscape shot so you can remember the beauty of the area that you visit. However, you should also try to get in some of those photos yourself! Don’t be shy about asking locals to take your photo by that landmark or against that stunning backdrop. You’ll be grateful for the memories when you look back on these photos when you get older.\n\nWrite Down Important Addresses\nBe prepared for those moments when your laptop or cell phone die. Make sure to have the address of the spot you’re staying in written down in a safe spot. You never know when you will need that information!\n\nRead the Local Paper\nGet an idea of things that are going on in your area by reading the local paper. Whether it’s a daily newspaper or a weekly magazine, these are often stocked with local events, restaurants, galleries, and museums to check out.",

        "content": "Summer is here and we think it’s time for you to take a hike! Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston, Oregon residents and visitors have access to some of the most stunning and diverse landscapes in the country; whether it’s climbing majestic sand dunes or biking through a rugged coastal forest or walking along paths overlooking the Pacific, and now is the time to grab your hiking boots and head this way for a beautiful adventure.\n\nHere are five hiking destinations to explore this summer (or any time of the year) on Oregon’s Adventure Coast:\n\nPlease note, hiking conditions are subject to weather patterns and other elements outside our control. Please check the websites posted with each listing below before heading out.\n\n#1 OREGON DUNES NATIONAL RECREATION AREA\n\nWhen one of the largest areas of temperate coastal sand dunes in the world is located in your back yard, you hike it! Miles and miles of towering wind-sculpted sand dunes make the famed Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area a perfect location for hiking and photo opportunities. Though there are numerous trails to choose from, here are a few that captured our imagination:\n\nBluebill Lake Trail\nTrail Length: 1.2 mile\nLevel of Difficulty: Easy\nTrail Features:\n\nGreat for hiking, walking and bird watching\nGreat lake views and extensive boardwalk for wildlife viewing\nDogs allowed on leash\nOpen Year Round\nMore info & maps can be found at alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/bluebill-lake-trail\n\nJohn Dellenback Trail\nTrail Length: 5.4 miles round-trip (There's also a shorter, family-friendly route of just 1 mile)\nLevel of Difficulty: Moderate- Challenging\nTrail Features\n\nA variety of terrain and sweeping views of the dunes, beach, and coastal forest\nStunning vegetation and wildflowers\nAccessible year-round\nDogs allowed on a leash\nMore info & maps can be found at alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/john-dellenback-trail\n\n#2 SHORE ACRES LOOP HIKE- Sunset Bay to Simpson Beach\n\nThis section of the Oregon Coast Trail, open year-round, is regarded by many as one of the most beautiful hikes in the state of Oregon. Dense, coastal forests, rugged sandstone cliffs, and majestic vista points provide make this a very popular destination for nature lovers and hikers of all levels. Be sure to bring a camera with you for the all but certain wildlife photo opportunities you’ll encounter.\nTrail Length: 4.7 miles\nDifficulty: Easy\nTrail Features:\n\nPremium tide pool exploration opportunities at Sunset Bay State Park & Simpson Beach\nShore Acres State Park, the crown jewel of Oregon’s South Coast\nGreat views of Gregory Point and Cape Arago Lighthouse\nDramatic vistas of the Pacific\nCoastal forests\nAccess to restrooms, picnic, and camping facilities\nMore info & maps can be found at oregonhikers.org/fieldguide/ShoreAcresLoopHike\n\n#3 CAPE ARAGO LOOP\n\nThis scenic, oceanfront trail is typically less traveled than other trails mentioned in this post. Located 15 minutes from Coos Bay, this hiking destination is the perfect place to lose yourself in nature. “This hike features the quieter side of the spectacular Sunset Bay, Shore Acres and Cape Arago complex of state parks south of Coos Bay,” writes Zach Urness in this 2016 Statesman Journal article. “Before starting the loop hike, take the time to explore two short treks just off the parking area. The North and South Cove trails lead to tidepools, beaches and viewpoints where you can say hello to barking sea lion.”  Please note the North Cove Trail is closed March 1st – June 30th to protect seal pups.\n\nTrail Length: The entire loop is 4.3 miles\nLevel of Difficulty: Moderate- challenging\nTrail Features:\n\nA moderately challenging trek through dense coastal forests\nA rare World War II bunker hidden among the brush\nNatural scenery and sweeping views of the Pacific.\nViews of seals and sea lions on Simpson Reef and Shell Island\nMore info & maps can be found at www.oregonhikers.org/fieldguide/CapeAragoLoopHike\n\n#4 SOUTH SLOUGH NATIONAL ESTUARINE RESEARCH RESERVE\n\n The trails at South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR) are one of Oregon’s best-kept secrets. In addition to its unbeatable natural surroundings, SSNERR hikers have access to some of the best birding spots that Oregon has to offer, so be sure to bring binoculars with you! Hikers say these trails are well maintained and relatively easy to hike, however, there are uphill portions to conquer so be prepared!  We recommend downloading a free trail map if you’re planning to make the trek!\n\nTrail Length: Ranges from 2.2 miles to 3.5 miles\nLevel of Difficulty: Easy- Moderate\nTrail Features:\n\nHiking trails for all ability levels\nBoardwalk that winds through fresh and saltwater marshes\nLush coastal Vegetation and wildlife\nInterpretive center with restrooms\nAccessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.\nMore info & maps can be found at alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/south-slough\n\n#5 GOLDEN AND SILVER FALLS\n\nLocated almost an hour's drive from Coos Bay at the end of Coos River Highway, Golden and Silver Falls is 24 miles off Highway 101. A hidden gem in the dense coastal forests of southwest Oregon, Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area may be hard to find, but it’s well worth drive and the drive is certainly part of the adventure. A small parking and picnic area is located along the banks of Glenn and Silver Creeks, set in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, Big Leaf Maple and Oregon myrtle trees. Hiking trails wind through scenic canyons to each of the waterfalls that plunge over sheer rock cliffs to moss-covered boulders 100 feet below.\n\nTrail Length: 1.4 miles\nLevel of Difficulty: Easy\nTrail Features:\n\nTwo of Oregon’s most beautiful waterfalls\nLush coastal forests, giant old-growth firs and cedars\nPicnic tables, restrooms\nTons of photo opps\nMore info & maps can be found at alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/golden-and-silver-falls",

        "title": "Kayak Fishing 101 on Oregon’s Adventure Coast",
        "content": "\"Many go fishing all their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after.\" - Henry David Thoreau\n\nKayak fishing is more popular than ever on Oregon’s South Coast, and with the 10th Annual Sunset Bay Angler Of The Day Kayak Fishing Challenge coming up August 24th, we thought this would the perfect time to share some answers to commonly asked questions about kayak fishing on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.\n\nWhat’s so special about kayak fishing, you may ask? Many people will say that they are drawn to this growing watersport for the purpose of ease and simplicity. You are not required to buy or rent expensive equipment and the sport is accessible to anglers of all skill levels. “Most fishing kayaks will float in 6\" of water while holding up to 350 pounds of cargo,” writes Jerry White in Why Fish From a Kayak. “Not only does that make it easier to get on the water, but usually these places aren't accessible to conventional boats, either by law (designated as a \"No Motor Zone\") or by nature itself. .\n\nIn addition to being more accessible, kayak fishing offers serenity and unsurpassed views of natural habitats and scenery that can only be found deep in the lakes, rivers and open water along the Pacific coastline.\n\nWhere Can I Rent Kayaks and Fishing Gear?\nUnless you’re BYOY (bring your own yak) you’ll need to rent one from one of our local businesses.\n\nWaxer’s Surf Shop in Coos Bay is a great place to rent a quality kayak and other sports gear and equipment from helpful, knowledgeable staff members.\nSouth Coast Tours, one of Oregon’s premier guided tour companies is now partnering with Oregon State Parks to offer kayaking rental packages right on Sunset Bay State Park between 10am-4pm on weekends.\nThe newly opened Bahama Boards in Coos Bay is another solid local resources to rent kayaks (or purchase) in addition to the gear, clothing, and accessories you may need as you explore the Pacific ocean waters, lakes and rivers!\n\nAn Oregon fishing license is required for those age 12 years or older. Daily licenses are available. Most fishing charters, bait shops and sporting goods stores can supply these for you. Check out our fishing license requirement page for where to buy a licenses and bait. You can also find a list of local businesses that can help by clicking here.\n\nWhere are the best places in our area to do kayak fishing?\n\nSunset Bay State Park is a local favorite among kayakers. Known for its calm waters and easy access to the beach, Sunset Bay State Park is an ideal location for kayak anglers who want to head offshore into the ocean in search of cabezon, lingcod, and halibut.\nThe calm waters in nearby Woahink, Siltcoos, Lake Marie or Saunders lakes are good for bass, trout and perch.\nThe Umpqua, Coos or Coquille rivers are ideal destinations for kayakers who are searching for chinook salmon.\n\nWhen is the best time to go? Depending on the weather forecast, anglers of all skill levels can easily access the lakes and rivers and ocean waters (via Sunset Bay State Park) on Oregon’s South Coast any time of the year. When you go also depends on what species of fish you’re after. Download our Fishing Information Rack Card here (PDF). We strongly recommend checking current fishing conditions and requirements by going to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife website. Visitors will also find excellent tips and recommendations by calling local businesses like Basin Tackle Shop and Bite’s On Bait & Tackle. Here’s a list of other recommended businesses that can offer helpful tips, equipment and gear.\n\nIt’s no surprise that the abundance of calm lakes, rivers and beaches on Oregon’s South Coast make this area a prime destination for kayak fishing. If you need help finding a place to stay or have additional questions about our area, please feel free to stop by or contact the Coos Bay- North Bend VIsitor & Convention Bureau at (541) 269-0215 or email us at info@oregonsadventurecoast.com.\n\nAdditional Reading for Kayak Fishing  \nhttps://oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2017-03-30-what-to-pack-on-your-oregon-coast-fishing-trip/\n[https://www.theadventurejunkies.com/kayak-fishing-tips/\nhttps://anglr.com/kayak-fishing-tips/](https://www.theadventurejunkies.com/kayak-fishing-tips/ https://anglr.com/kayak-fishing-tips/)\nhttps://oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing/\nhttp://www.mitchellfishing.com/Mitchell-education-kayak-fishing-tips.html\nhttps://bendingbranches.com/blog/my-top-kayak-fishing-tips-beginners\nhttps://oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2018-05-18-featured-adventure-take-a-kayak-tour-on-oregons-south-coast/",

        "content": "With so many calm lakes, rivers and beaches to choose from, Oregon's Adventure Coast is a haven for Kayaking and Stand-Up Paddleboarding (SUP) and outdoor lovers of all skill levels. Taking a tour with a professional guide is an excellent way to experience the natural beauty of Oregon's south coast like never before.\n\nOne of Oregon's premier guided tour companies,  South Coast Tours (SCT), recently announced they are partnering with Oregon State Parks to offer kayaking and stand up paddle boarding rental packages from their new location at Sunset Bay State Park starting June 15th! Stand up paddle boards and kayaks will be available to rent from 10am-4pm.\n\niframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsouthcoasttours%2Fposts%2F1942696295832629&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"420\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"/iframe\n\nThis is welcome news in our community because the beautiful waters on Oregon's Adventure Coast are more accessible than ever for fans of the outdoors and watersports. We can't think of a better destination for watersports than Sunset Bay State Park. Known for its calm waters flanked by offshore rocks and beautiful sandy beaches, this local gem gives ocean lovers easy access to its beaches, making it an ideal location for kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding.\n\nSouth Coast Tours is no stranger to introducing kayaking, stand up paddle boarding and kayak fishing to the public. The company has been offering guided adventure paddle tours of rivers, estuaries and along shores of Oregon's Southern Coast for years. Their sincere passion for the outdoors and commitment to sustainability and ocean preservation sets them apart from many others.\n\nSouth Coast Tours Owner & Guide, Dave Lacey, was featured recently on an episode of Facing Waves, a TV series that follows seasoned paddlers as they explore the world's top paddling destinations. You can watch the episode here.\n\nFor more local adventure ideas with South Coast Tours, consider the South Slough Coos Bay Wildlife Viewing Kayak Tour for epic wildlife viewing or explore the Bandon Marsh U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Reserve on their Bandon Coquille River Tour.\n\nWaxer's Surf Shopand Bahama Boards are also great resources to rent kayaks and paddle boards (or purchase) in addition to gear, clothing, and accessories you may need as you explore the Pacific ocean waters, lakes and rivers!\n\nWhether you're embarking on a guided tour or a self-guided tour, exploring the peaceful waterways along Oregon's South Coast is an unforgettable adventure the entire family can enjoy.

        "title": "Ten Oregon Coast Travel Tips for Charleston Salmon Run Visitors",
        "content": "Oregon’s South Coast is a runner’s haven. Not only is this the hometown of one of our country’s greatest running icons, the late Steve Prefontaine, but the region is also filled with natural running trails, temperate weather and coastal beauty that can’t be found anywhere else in the country.\n\nEvery September, runners from all over the world travel here to compete in the Prefontaine Memorial Run, a challenging 10K road race across one of Steve Prefontaine’s training courses here in Coos Bay. The 40th Annual Prefontaine Memorial Race, part of the Bay Area Fun Festival, is coming up on September 21, 2019.\n\nThe race featured in this post, however, is the 3rd Annual Oregon's Adventure Coast Charleston Salmon Run and Crab Walk happening October 5th on one of the most beautiful courses in Oregon. The race begins and ends in Charleston, Oregon and follows amazing scenic routes along rugged sea cliffs and sandy beaches. Runners (and their cheering squad) of all levels are invited to participate. The Salmon Run includes a 26.2-mile Marathon, 13.1-mile Half Marathon, 10K run and the 1 mile Crab Walk so there is something for every activity level in this event!\n\nAfter the run, join the fun at the annual Octoberfish, the official after party of the Oregon's Adventure Coast Charleston Salmon Run! But don’t rush off once the party is over! Stick around and experience more of what Oregon’s Adventure Coast has to offer! Here are some tips to help you enjoy the very best of Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston, Oregon during your visit this fall.\n\n 1 PACK LAYERS\n\nLayered clothing allows you to adjust for changes in temperature accordingly. While our area is temperate year-round, there are daily fluctuations. Be sure to check the local, extended forecast before you go. We encourage you to bring hiking boots if you plan to explore. A light, waterproof jacket and sweaters help with the evening breezes and depending on the season, a combination of shorts and long pants will give you some options for daytime adventures.\n\n2 FUEL UP ON DELICIOUS FOOD & DRINK!\n\nThere are a number of local restaurants dishing out the freshest seafood and chowder you could possibly hope for! Though there are too many to mention in one post, here are a few ideas to whet your appetite.\n\nIf you’re in Charleston, grab some chowder at Chuck’s Seafood or High Tide Café. You can’t go wrong with the popular Fish ’n Chips at Miller’s At the Cove Sports Bar & Grill. The Wildflour Cafe in North Bend along with these newer locally-owned restaurants are getting rave reviews from locals and visitors alike. There are a number of establishments that have stood the test of time like Shark Bites in Coos Bay, Hilltop House Restaurant and Lounge, Fisherman’s Grotto, Blue Heron Bistro, Fisherman’s Seafood Market, Captain’s Choice Family Fish House and many more. At the end of the day, grab a craft beverage at 7 Devils Brewing Co in Coos Bay.\n\nDownload our Local Restaurant Guide to carry with you or visit oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining to see all of our local restaurants.\n\n3 EXPLORE THE SIGHTS ON CAPE ARAGO HIGHWAY\n\nWhile you’re visiting, spend some time exploring the beaches and state parks along the Cape Arago Highway. Take a walk and watch the surfers on Bastendorff Beach or search for natural treasures in tidepools in the protected beach in Sunset Bay State Park. We recommend grabbing your binoculars and taking some time to explore the Simpson Reef and nearby Shell Island to view and listen to the seals and sea lions. Be sure to look for sea lions, harbor seals, and occasional elephant seals in the viewing area overlooking Shell Island. Download this guide to help on your route. Please do not touch the wildlife under any circumstances!\n\n4 LEARN & FOLLOW CRITICAL SAFETY GUIDELINES WHILE YOU’RE NEAR THE OCEAN\n\nOur quiet, peaceful, undeveloped beaches are ideal for training runs, long walks, hiking, photography, picnicking, and tide-pooling, but if you ignore these guidelines, what should be a beautiful day by the Pacific Ocean could suddenly become unsafe without warning.\n\n5 GO FISHING, CLAMMING OR CRABBING\n\nAutumn is a lovely time of year to visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast and fishing, crabbing and clamming opportunities are in no short supply here! There are more than 30 lakes and rivers to choose from in Coos County alone, and anglers will find there is plenty of bay and ocean fishing. Click here for a list of resources that will be helpful in planning your trip. Be sure to visit one of our bait shops while in the area, they’re always willing to share pointers with visiting anglers. Learn more about crabbing & clamming on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.\n\n6 TRY YOUR LUCK IN ONE OF OUR CASINOS\n\nDid you know that our little corner of the Pacific Northwest is home to two of the area’s best casinos? Whether its slots, cards, or games, you’re sure to find round-the-clock adventure, fun, and (fingers crossed) millions right here.\n\nOur two casinos are located within a ten-minute drive of each other, so play your cards right and visit both.  Learn more.\n\n7 VISIT AN ART AND/OR HISTORY MUSEUM\n\nSpend some time browsing the museums, galleries, and other cultural gems in our area like the Coos Art Museum where runners can see the rare personal items of champion runner Steve Prefontaine, the cornerstone of visual arts on Oregon’s Southern Coast and the Coos History Museum, Oregon’s oldest continuously operated historical society boasting more than 250,000 historic photographs. Click here to see more wonderful additions to our network of museums and galleries.\n\n8 LEARN SOMETHING NEW\n\nThe 6,000-square-foot Charleston Marine Life Center, located on the campus of UO’s Institute of Marine Biology features permanent exhibits including a Marine Ecosystem Gallery, an Underwater Oregon Gallery (where after just a few minutes exploring, you’re likely to see a multitude of marine life you may have never known existed) and an Oregon Fisheries Gallery (an open-air deck where visitors can see fishing vessels coming and going from the harbor). Visit oimb.uoregon.edu for more info.\n\nWe also recommend spending a day at the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve Interpretive Center learning about our local culture, history and natural resources. There are miles of beautiful hiking trails and waterways to explore in addition to classes/workshops for all ages.\n\n9 GO FOR A STROLL ALONG THE CHARLESTON MARINA COMPLEX\n\nCharleston is home to a marina and boatyard that support thriving commercial and recreational fleets. With nearly 200 commercial fishing boats and 250 or so recreational boats, the docks and boatyard are busy year-round. Our fishermen bring in fresh Oregon Dungeness crab and pink shrimp, both officially sustainable seafood fisheries. The Coos Bay Boardwalk along with the North Bend Boardwalk are also lovely to explore.\n\n10 EXPLORE THE SHOPS DOWNTOWN\n\nYou never know what you’ll find in our unique shops on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. The Charleytown Marketplace is a popular spot for visitors looking for special Oregon-made and other hand-crafted items. With its top-notch outdoor clothing and fishing gear, Englund Marine (next door) is the place for outdoor enthusiasts. Don’t miss Kinnee’s Gifts and Shells, featuring trinkets and other coastal items along with Boat Basin Plaza featuring an eclectic mix of merchandise.\n\nWhile you’re here, shop for treasures in the eclectic retail stores in the Coos Bay downtown area. Local favorites include: Tru, Vintage 101, Leaf’s Treehouse, Organic Glass Art & Gifts, Katrina Kathleen’s and Canard Labs, Oregon Wine Cellars, Checkerberries, Artist Loft Gallery and so many more! The Coos History Museum Gift Shop provides visitors with a look at our history and culture. And a visit to Coos Bay is not complete without a stop at Cranberry Sweets for their unique take on cranberry candies and other delicious selections.\n\nNorth Bend’s quaint downtown offers shoppers a blend of gift, antique and clothing stores to choose from, including, Painted Zebra, Petal to the Metal, Books by the Bay, Fat Cat Antiques, Mossy Rose, and many others. Other shopping options in North Bend include the Pony Village Mall, The Myrtlewood Factory, and Ko-Kwel Gifts at The Mill Casino.\n\nDownload this walking map of Downtown Coos Bay & North Bend.\n\nThere is an adventure for everyone on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

        "content": "The 14th Annual Charleston “Ahh Shucks!” Oyster Feed, our annual celebration of fresh oysters, is coming up April 27th which got us thinking about where to find the very best oysters in the Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston area? We asked around and here’s what we found out.\n\nAh Shucks! 14th Annual Charleston Oyster Feed\nIf you are an oyster lover, the Ah Shucks! 14th Annual Charleston Oyster Feed is the place you need to be on April 27th.  This is a prime opportunity to taste delicious, fresh-from-Coos-Bay oysters provided by several of our local growers.\n\nOysters will be prepared in a variety of ways and will be served with dipping sauces, baked beans, coleslaw, garlic bread and a choice of beverages. Not a fan of oysters? No problem, there will also be options for you too. The event will also include live music, wine and plenty of fun.\n\nLocal Growers\nIf you can’t make it to this year’s oyster feed, not to worry. Some of the best oysters on the planet are harvested by local growers year round. Some of our finest local growers include  Clausen's Silverpoint Oyster Co., the largest oyster farm in the State of Oregon. Clausen's is consistently recommended by locals for their fresh and shucked oysters as well as smoked oysters, BBQ Garlic-Parmesan Butter Oysters, Chowder and other delicious selections. Stop in to pick up fresh oysters to take home or stick around and enjoy a meal in their new deli/restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. You cannot miss their signs when you are driving North or South on Highway 101, North of North Bend and North of McCullough Bridge.\n\nAnother local oyster grower to put on your radar is Qualman Oyster Farms in Charleston. One of the original oyster farms on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, Qualman’s grows their oysters in the South Slough sanctuary in immaculate and pristine conditions. Fans of Qualman’s say that they have the best oysters due to the quality of the water at the sanctuary which gives them an almost sweeter taste than oysters harvested from the bay. All oysters are hand grown, handpicked, local and reasonably priced.\n\nQualman Oyster Farms is located at 63218 Troller Rd. If you’re heading to Charleston on Cape Arago Highway, make a left just before the bridge. Other growers in town producing quality oysters include Coos Bay Oyster Co., North Bend Oyster Co., Pacific Choice in Charleston.\n\nWhen asked “Who has the best oysters in town?” an overwhelming number of respondents recommended Chuck’s Seafood, family-owned seafood market in Charleston, Oregon.  When visiting our area, a stop at this iconic market is a must for any seafood lover before heading home. Chucks is famous for its outstanding selection of freshly shucked oysters, and their smoked oysters like Garlic-Pepper Smoked Coos Bay Oysters are a favorite among locals and visitors alike.\n\nRestaurants\nIf you’ve got a hankering for good oysters while you’re out and about, we have several restaurants in town that are likely to have a dish to satisfy your craving. Restaurants like Fisherman's Grotto- \"The oysters were amazing...\", Captain's Choice Fish House- \"We absolutely loved the food, the best & freshest oysters I've had.\" SharkBite's Seafood Cafe- \"Wonderful oysters! My partner and I split the house salad and ...\" and Restaurant O- \"Oysters with lemon air Beetroot Hummus plate Salmon Sorrel Crab ...\" are great spots for oyster lovers. You’ll also want to try  The Oysters Rockefeller at Millers At The Cove, BBQ oysters at Coach House, The B.O.L.T. (bacon, oysters, lettuce, tomato) at Blue Heron Bistro, the Fried oysters appetizer at 7 Devils Brewing and grilled oysters at Tokyo Bistro.\n\nClick here for a complete list of the best oysters in Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston as listed on Yelp.",

        "title": "Oregon Coast Winter Steelhead Fishing Tips for 2019",
        "content": "Winter steelhead fishing is one of our most popular outdoor recreational activities here in Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston during the winter months. We recently asked one of our local fishing experts, Gary Vonderohe from the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife, to share some tips to help anglers get the most out of their winter steelhead fishing trip.\n\nWith a lack of rain in November through mid-December,  our winter steelhead fishing season was off to a slow start. However,  more rain in the forecast means that winter steelhead have begun moving into the Coos and Coquille basins. Here's what anglers need to know for this season:\n\nCoos and Millicoma rivers.\n\nIf you are fishing in the Coos Basin, anglers can only harvest hatchery adipose fin clipped winter steelhead.\nHatchery steelhead are released in the West Fork Millicoma, East Fork Millicoma, and South Fork Coos rivers.\nSteelhead fishing on the East Fork and West Fork Millicoma rivers is best from December through mid-February.\nPublic access on the East Fork Millicoma River is limited mainly to the Coos County’s Nesika Park.\nOn the West Fork Millicoma River, public access can be found at the Millicoma Interpretive Center and scout camp.\nSteelhead fishing on the South Fork Coos River is best from December through mid-March.\nAccess on the South Fork Coos River above tidewater is all through Weyerhaeuser property. Anglers will need to purchase a fishing access permit from Weyerhaeuser on their recreation access website.\n\nCoquille River.\n\nIn the Coquille Basin, hatchery steelhead are released in the North Fork and South Fork Coquille rivers.\nPublic angler access on the North Fork Coquille is primarily through Coos County’s Laverne Park. When fishing conditions are good most of the fishing holes are taken.\nOn the South Fork Coquille River there is some limited public bank fishing access sites but the river fishes best from a drift boat. The best stretches are from Beaver Creek (roughly halfway between Powers and Myrtle Point) downstream to Myrtle Point.\nBest fishing on the North Fork is from December through early March.\nBest fishing on the South Fork is from December through early April.\nThe East Fork Coquille River is the only river in the Coos and Coquille basin where an angler has the option to harvest a wild winter steelhead.  Harvest is limited to 1 wild steelhead per day and only 3 per year.\n\nThe best time to head out is after a heavy rain. Fishing for winter steelhead is almost always best after a heavy rain to get fish moving upstream but heavy rain will make the rivers unfishable for a few days.\n\nThe West Fork Millicoma and North Fork Coquille rivers are the first rivers in the area to clear up after a rain. The East Fork Millicoma River will be the next river to become fishable followed up by the South Fork Coos and South Fork Coquille rivers.\n\nAvoid the crowd by going mid-day. To escape some of the crowding on these winter steelhead rivers, I like to start fishing mid-day.  Most steelhead anglers will be on the river at first light and typically quit by late morning.\n\nGary's advice for beginners: For a beginning steelhead angler, fishing with a jig under a bobber is an easy way to start which can be very effective with catching steelhead. The local fishing tackle shops can set you up with the appropriate gear if you don’t know where to start.\n\nBe prepared to lose some tackle. The rivers in the Coos Basin and the North Fork and East Fork Coquille rivers are dominated by jagged bedrock.  Because of this be prepared to lose quite a bit of tackle when drifting your hook near the river bottom. The South Fork Coquille River has a lot less exposed bedrock and more gravel runs which makes it easier to drift your bait/lure near the bottom.\n\nTips for fly fishermen: For those anglers that like to fly fish for winter steelhead, drifting an egg pattern under a strike indicator is a popular technique which fish well in these bedrock dominated rivers.  There are a few places on all these rivers where it works well to swing flies through a run.\n\nThree adult fish per day. From December 1 through April 30 each season, steelhead anglers in the Coos and Coquille basins are able to keep an additional fin-clipped steelhead per day for a total aggregate of 3 adult fish harvested per day.\n\nTo learn more, be sure to check with the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife for the most up-to-date recreation report and visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast for a list of local bait and tackle shops. Visit our website to learn about more fresh water fishing options in Coos Bay.\n\nYou can also learn more by reading the following posts:\n\nWinter Fun On Oregon’s Adventure Coast\n\nWinter Steelhead Fishing Trip Idea",

Inspired by the great western dance bands of Bob Wills, Tex Williams, Spade Cooley, and Billy Jack Wills!\n\nDAVE BENNETT QUARTET – This powerhouse band enthralls audiences with toe-tapping swing, moody blues, and emotional ballads, all performed with deft touch, virtuosity, and style. Not only does the quartet feature music from the Swing era, but they also touch on country, rockabilly and pop, with original brand-new jazz compositions thrown in. Audiences will hear the influences of Benny Goodman, Pete Fountain, Jerry Lee Lewis, even Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel in this group’s music.\n\nBAY CITY SWING – Formerly Evolution of The Oregon Coast Lab Band, Bay City Swing is comprised of former Evolution members along with a few new faces. Still associated with the Oregon Coast Lab Band, Bay City Swing is a collaboration of all the musicians in the band. Officially starting in early July 2017, Bay City Swing has very quickly made an impact in Oregon’s Bay Area and the festival world. The band has a Big Band feel and Crooner styling that swing across many decades.\n\nGATOR NATION – The West Coast’s premiere Cajun, Zydeco, and New Orleans R&B band, is a hand-clapping, foot-stomping, high energy concert and dance band. With the same survival instinct as its namesake, Gator Nation continues to adapt itself to its audiences, always with something fresh yet true to its calling. That calling is to represent the music of South Louisiana in all its forms, Cajun, Zydeco, and New Orleans style.\n\nGOOD CO. – As the United States’ first Electro Swing Band, Good Co is proud to present this new genre to hep cats everywhere. Pounding dance beats are mixed with gypsy jazz guitar riffs, samples from the past turned on their head along with a live horn section make for the best sounding dance party this side of the 1920s.\n\nGINO & THE LONE GUNMEN – Featuring a rockin’ mix of ROCKABILLY, SWING, BLUES, COUNTRY, and Vintage ROCK and ROLL.  Their song catalog includes rockin and swingin original music, as well as all your favorites, including everything from Elvis and Buddy Holly to the Cavern Club days of the Beatles! The Lone Gunmen have shared the stage with many other great bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Slim Jim Phantom(Stray Cats), Three Bad Jacks, Big Sandy and more, and after making their debut at the 2012 Viva Las Vegas festival, the band has been quickly gaining more and more fans from around the world!\n\nLISA MANN – This super talented musician has been awarded the prestigious 2016 Blues Music Award for her mighty skills on the bass guitar, an award which she also took home in 2015. Her first award win fell hot on the heels of her win for Blues Blast’s Sean Costello Rising Star Award, as well as three Muddy Waters Awards from the Cascade Blues Association for Contemporary Blues Act of the Year, Bass Player of the Year, and Northwest Recording of the Year. Her latest release, Hard Times, Bad Decisions debuted on the Living Blues radio chart at 7, and on the International Blues Broadcasters Association chart at #10, and can be heard burning up the airwaves worldwide.\n\nPHAT CAT SWINGER  – Founding members Marco Palos and Will Pattinson teamed up to create and refine the Phat Cat sound.  Booming toms, jumpin’ rhythms, and a powerful horn section blended with the sweet vocals of Curtis Parry were all the perfect ingredients for their creation.  It became known as “Phat Cat Swinger” a West Coast “little-big” band that specializing in high-energy music with a vintage touch!\n\nROYAL JELLY JIVE – Few bands have the ability to evoke an old-school throwback vibe and yet sound entirely fresh and new at the same time. Royal Jelly Jive is one of those bands. Combining elements of Soul, Rock, Swing and Hip-Hop, Royal Jelly Jive shakes up every dance-party and grooves harder than your typical rock n’ roll band dares to go. It is all fronted by enigmatic singer Lauren Bjelde, whose sultry voice and songwriting lands somewhere in-between Amy Winehouse and Tom Waits.\n\nDAVE STUCKEY & THE HOT HOUSE GANG – This band is a hard-swinging, take-no-prisoners aggregation, playing the standards and not-so-standards from the 1920’s & 30s …and whose main objective is to bring the heat, get you out of your seat, and provoke you to move your feet. Bringing with him a Murderer’s Row of torrid trad jazz operators from the wilds of Los Angeles, Stuckey’s outfit channels an Eddie Condon small-group drive with jiving vocals that may conjure thoughts of Wingy Manone or Fats Waller.\n\nTHE YOUNG BUCS – Whether it’s Gene Chandler’s “Duke of Earl” or “Little Darlin”, made famous by The Diamonds, THE YOUNG BUCS Doo-Wop division take you back to the ‘50’s, and the days before IPods and cell phones. The Young Bucs may take you back to the ’50s, but having been a teen during that era is not a prerequisite to enjoying this music.  The style and themes of the music from the doo-wop era are classic and timeless. Audiences of all ages continue to be entertained as The Young Bucs bring it to life.\n",

First settled thousands of years ago, native tribes found abundant food and a temperate climate. These tribes continued to inhabit the region when exploration and trapping in the area began in the early 1800’s. And in 1853, a permanent settlement was established by members of the Coos Bay Company.\n\nWagon roads first connected Coos Bay to Jacksonville and Roseburg, in the 1850’s. The Port of Coos Bay, which may be the best natural harbor between San Francisco Bay and the Puget Sound, is the world’s largest forest products shipping port. Gold drew people in the 1800’s. Many coal mines operated between 1890-1910; the last mine closed in 1950.\n\nToday, forest products, tourism, fishing and agriculture dominate the economy. Boating, dairy farming, myrtlewood production, shipbuilding and specialty farm products like cranberries, play a key role.",

Coos Bay is also the birthplace of legendary runner, Steve Prefontaine.\n\nThe name Coos Bay is derived from one of the area’s Native American tribes and has two Indian meanings – lake, and place of pines, both very fitting for this area. Several Native American Tribes called the Coos Bay region their ancestral homeland including the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, and the Coquille Indians.\n\nToday, you’ll find intriguing restaurants, gourmet coffee houses, antique shops, gift shops, the Coos History Museum, and the Coos Art Museum, the 3rd oldest art museum in Oregon. Thanks to Coos Bay’s progressive vision, you’ll find a rejuvenated and quickly changing downtown area with growing retail and service sectors. The downtown area known as the Old Marshfield district is adjacent to the Coos Bay Boardwalk where locals and visitors alike can often be seen enjoying the waterfront views.

        "content": "{{ floatimage src=\"/img/prefontaine-tall-image.jpg\" float=\"right\" alt=\"Thousand miler Steve Prefontaine leads the field during the mile run in high school.\" }}\n\nWe want to introduce you to one of Oregon’s greatest sports legends, Steve Prefontaine, who’s pursuit for Olympic medals was a driving factor in the American running craze in the mid-1970s.\n\nDuring his brief 24-year life-span, Steve Prefontaine grew from hometown hero, to record-setting college phenomenon, to internationally acclaimed track star. In that time, he claimed seven NCAA titles, a fourth-place Olympic finish in 1972 (5K), and American records from 2,000 meters through 10,000 meters. a href=\"https://goducks.com/sports/2003/12/18/30594.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"Click here for more of his records./a\n\nWe in the Coos Bay area, hold a special place for Steve here where he was born in 1951 and discovered his gift for running fast and far as a student at Marshfield High School. It was here, he developed his foundation of commitment; working to be the best in the field, and doing it his way. He was one-of-a-kind and when he ran those fortunate enough to witness it, saw something they had never seen before, or since. He was one of those rare people who combine talent, discipline, determination, and natural celebrity with a single-minded vision. This is what made Pre the inspiration to those he called “his people”. Even now, decades after his death, devoted fans who came to watch him run and entered into the performance with roars of encouragement, still shout, “Go Pre!” \n\nEvery September, at the Prefontaine Memorial Run in Coos Bay, participants honor Steve with a challenging 10K road race across one of his old training courses, with its finish line at the high school track where he first competed. Click here for more information about the race.\n\nHere are some facts about this local legend:\n\nWHO WAS STEVE PREFONTAINE, “Pre” to his fans?\n\nHe was born and raised in Coos Bay.\nPre was a 2-time State 2-mile champion and 2-time State Cross Country Champion.\nSet the National Record in the 2-mile at the Corvallis Invitational in 1969.\nGraduated from MHS in 1969.\nAfter just completing high school, he qualified for the USA National team and competed in international meets against the USSR, Germany, Great Britain and a combined European team.\nHe entered the UO in the fall of 1969 as one of the most highly recruited high school track athletes ever.\nHe won 3 NCAA XC titles and 4 NCAA 3-mile championships.\nHe set American records at various distances 14 times.\nPre won the 1972 Olympic trials 5000 meters in Eugene to qualify for the Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, where he finished 4th in one of the greatest Olympic 5000M races of all-time.\n10. He fought vigorously for athletes’ rights against the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), an organization in those days that totally controlled where athletes competed, where they stayed, how they traveled—all aspects of an athlete’s life.\n11. Pre defied the AAU by organizing a series of meets with a group of Finnish athletes. One of these meets was held at Marshfield High School on 5-9-75, at which Pre set his last American record. The last of those meets was held at Hayward Field in Eugene on May 29th, and tragically, just hours after the conclusion of that meet, Pre was killed in an auto accident near Hendricks Park just above the UO campus.\n12. At the time of his death, Pre held every American distance running record from 2-miles through 10,000 meters.\n\n WHY WAS PRE SO POPULAR THEN AND NOW?\n\nHis running style made him a fan favorite—he was a front-runner.\nHe knew only one speed—all-out\nPre never avoided racing against anyone at any distance, even though he knew in many cases he would have very little chance of winning.\nHe was vociferous in speaking out to advocate for athletes’ rights against the dictatorial, clubby AAU.\nHe died young at the peak of his career, leaving unfulfilled the great promise of many more years of great performances.\nHollywood produced two full-length feature films of Pre’s life — Prefontaine and Without Limits. There is also a documentary film called Fire on the Track that is very inspiring and a book called Pre by Tom Jordan, who is now the meet director of the Prefontaine Classic track meet in Eugene. A children’s book, Steve Prefontaine-Rocketman by Bree Donovan was published in 2010.\n\nPrefontaine Letter Revealed at Olympic Trials 2008\n\nIn June 2008, during the Olympic Trials held in Eugene, OR,  the Coos Bay–North Bend Visitor & Convention Bureau (VCB) shared Steve Prefontaine’s hometown history. The VCB, along with the Mill Casino Hotel and 75 coastal volunteers, showcased their love of the area, promoted the annual Prefontaine Memorial Run in Coos Bay, and shared a part of Pre’s history. \n\ndiv style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 20px 0; width: 291px; text-align:center;\"a href=\"/img/pre-letter-march17th.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"img src=\"/img/Prefontaine-Letter.jpg\" width=\"296\" alt=\"Steve Prefontaine's Letter\"/strongRead Pre's Letter Here (PDF)/strong/a/divpThe VCB shared old photographs, racing programs, newspaper articles and the highlight of their display, a never before published letter written by Steve Prefontaine shortly before his death. The letter dated March 17th, was written to Prefontaine’s Marshfield High School coach, Walt McClure in 1975./p\n\nKatherine Hoppe, previous director of the Coos Bay–North Bend VCB said, “When Walt first brought the letter to me, I was afraid to even touch it, I was in awe. We’ve actually had a copy of it for months but have been waiting for just the right time to release it. With the opportunity to participate in the Eugene 08 festivities, we couldn’t think of a better time or place to share this letter.”\n\nPre writes of his training with Frank Shorter in Denver, of his battle with the AAU, getting ready for “the Finn” and of his intentions to begin training for the 76 Olympics.\n",

        "content": "We’re here to make your trip to Oregon’s Adventure Coast as uncomplicated as possible for you. Here are our tips for what to pack, what to wear, and need to know before you head out.\n\n{{ floatimage src=\"/img/state-map-oregon.jpg\" float=\"left\" alt=\"How to get here to Oregon's Adventure Coast by driving\" size=\"100\" }}\n\nGETTING HERE\n\nDirections from North I-5\nI-5 South to exit 162. Merge onto Hwy 38/Hwy 99 toward Drain/Elkton. Take Hwy 38 to Hwy 101 in Reedsport. Turn south on Hwy 101 and go approximately 26 miles.\n\nDirections from South 1-5\nI-5 North. Take exit 119 toward Hwy 99S/Winston/Hwy 42W/Coos Bay. Merge onto Coos Bay-Roseburg Hwy. Take a slight left at Maryland Ave then continue on 8th St/Coos Bay-Roseburg Hwy/ Hwy 42. Turn north on Hwy 101 and go approximately 5 miles.\n\nFlying Here (Airport Code OTH)\nYour gateway to Adventure begins at Southwest Oregon Regional Airport. We boast the only commercial airport on the Oregon Coast with daily, non-stop flights to and from San Francisco and seasonal non-stop flights to Denver. Serviced by United Express, for ticket information, please visit www.united.com.\n\n RULES OF THE ROAD\n\nThere’s a few things you need to know about driving in Oregon:\n\nHands Free – That means only hands free mobile devices are allowed to be in use while driving.\n\nGas Stations – In Oregon we pump your gas! So please sit back and relax and let one of our gas station attendants take care of you. Don’t be shy about asking for your windshield cleaned, we’re happy to serve you. Tipping is not required as this service is part of Oregon Law.\n\nSpeed Limits – Along most of the coastal portions of the Oregon coast, the speed limit ranges from 50 – 55 mph. Please be sure to follow the posted signs and give yourself a little extra time, we’d hate for a speeding ticket to taint your road trip. When approaching windy areas or towns along highway 101, be prepared to reduce your speed. The coastal route is so beautiful you won’t mind slowing down.\n\nWEATHER\n\nThe Climate - Coos County has a temperate, mild marine climate. We are spoiled because we don’t experience the dramatic highs and lows of the inland sections of the state. Temperatures range from annual mean highs of 59.5 to annual mean lows of 45.5 degrees. Oregon’s Adventure Coast has elevation from zero to 400 feet above sea level. We get a pleasant 63.48 inches average per-year rainfall along the coast. This keeps the lush greenery alive and helps maintain our agricultural industry. Almost half of our rain falls in November, December and January.\n\nWhat to Wear - While our area is temperate year round, there are seasonal fluctuations and daily ranges. Be sure to check the local, extended forecast. We encourage you to bring hiking boots if you plan to explore. A light, waterproof jacket and sweaters help with the evening breezes, and depending on the season, a combination of shorts and long pants will give you some options for daytime adventures.\n\nOregon’s Adventure Coast is a fairly casual area, so unless you are attending a specific formal event, casual dress will be welcomed most anywhere. While jeans are not always appropriate, khakis or Dockers fill the void. Pack smart and you won’t have any trouble at all.\n\n TRAVELING WITH PETS\n\nOf course you want to bring your best, four legged friend on your trip. After all, they are part of the family.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when bringing Fido along. Make sure you always keep your pet on a leash when in public areas. Oregon’s Adventure Coast has plenty of pet lodging options, services and play areas.\n\nTwo local favorite locations of pet owners are Horsfall Beach in North Bend and Bastendorff Beach in Charleston. Both have long stretches of beach for them to run and play. Dogs are allowed off leash provided they are well behaved and must be under owner’s control at all time.\n\nAnd for the adventures that you can’t bring your pet along, we have plenty of pet sitting services who can help out! Please keep in mind you should check in advance with care providers to see what pet records are required.\n\n{{ columns number=\"3\" }}\n\nCarol’s Pet Sitting\\\nCoos Bay and\\\nDunes City, OR\\\n(541) 297-6039\\\n{{ link url=\"https://www.facebook.com/Carols-Pet-Sitting-301592177499/\" }}Carol's Pet Sitting{{ /link }}\n\nPick up service at hotel or in town & short term care available for visitors; anywhere from a couple hours to long term stays.

        "content": "The Coquilles\n\n{{ floatimage src=\"/img/rowing-boat-01.jpg\" float=\"right\" alt=\"The Coquilles Rowing on Bay\" size=\"100\" }}\n\nThe Coquille Indian Tribe flourished in Oregon’s southwestern corner for thousands of years, cherishing the bountiful forests, rivers and beaches of a homeland encompassing more than 1 million acres. \n\nToday we number about 1,100 members, and we control about 10,000 acres of our ancestral homeland. We proudly manage the bulk of those lands as sustainable forest.\n\nUnlike many Indian tribes, we do not use the income from our tribal enterprises to make “per capita” payments to our members. Instead, we focus our efforts on strengthening our membership and building our people’s future – with education assistance, health care and elder services.\n\nWe proudly uphold the “potlatch” tradition of sharing with the community around us. The Mill Casino-Hotel and our other enterprises contribute more than $20 million a year in local salaries and benefits, and we purchase more than $25 million a year in local goods and services. Our Coquille Tribal Community Fund has distributed millions of dollars to the area’s non-profit organizations. \n\n Our Name\n\nVisitors sometimes wonder about the pronunciation of our name. The southwestern Oregon town of Coquille and the nearby Coquille River are both pronounced “ko-keel.”  So why does the tribe pronounce its name “ko-kwel”? \n\nThe simplest explanation is that the name “Coquille” derives from “scoquel,” a word for the eel-like lamprey that our people harvested for food.  When fur traders and settlers began arriving, the river and our people became known as “Coquell” or “Coquelle.” \n\nAlthough the spelling eventually evolved into “Coquille,” our tribe prefers the more traditional pronunciation.\n\nOur Way of Life\n\n{{ floatimage src=\"/img/rocks-waves-02.jpg\" float=\"right\" alt=\"Face Rock on the Oregon Coast\" size=\"100\" }}\n\nOur ancestors flourished among the forests, rivers, meadows and beaches of southwestern Oregon. The land and water offered an endless variety of life-sustaining resources, and our people adapted ingeniously to this waterside paradise. \n\nBerries, nuts, edible roots, fish, shellfish, and sea and land mammals all were abundant. The yew tree supplied raw material for bows. Arrows were made from hazel or ocean spray. Many plants provided materials for basketry: hazel, bear grass, ferns, cattails and others.\n\nAmong all plants, none was more important to our ancestors than cedar. These versatile trees provided logs for houses and canoes, and their bark could be fashioned into rainproof garments. Other cedar products included roofing, blankets, clothing and nets. Our ancestors even used cedar in their ceremonies, burning it for smoky “smudge.”\n\nIn these ways and others, the forests and waterways provided for all our ancestors’ needs.\n\n Our Languages\n\nOur tribe’s ancestors spoke two distinct languages. Those living near Bandon and along Coos Bay’s South Slough spoke Miluk, a dialect of the Penutian language family. Those farther south and east spoke an Athabaskan dialect, similar to tongues spoken in Alaska and the American Southwest. Many of our ancestors could speak more than one language – especially the women, who commonly married outside their home villages.\n\nSadly, the arrival of Euro-American culture quickly overwhelmed the native languages of the Oregon Coast. By the 20th century, the remaining Indian people primarily spoke English and the regional trade jargon known as “Chinuk Wawa.” Today’s Coquille Tribe is working to reconnect our people with our ancestors’ languages. \n\nOur Restoration\n\nThe U.S. government “terminated” the Coquille Tribe in 1954, denying our status as Indian people.  We joyfully regained federal recognition on June 28, 1989, when Congress passed the Coquille Restoration Act. We once again were recognized as a sovereign nation of Indian people.\n\nIn the 21st century, some of us are scattered throughout America and even around the world.  But many of us still live in places where our ancestors made their homes: Powers, Myrtle Point, Coquille, Bandon, the South Slough, Empire and others. Our eternal bond to this landscape is inseparable from our identity.\n\n Our Heritage\n\n{{ floatimage src=\"/img/arch-dig-3.jpg\" float=\"right\" alt=\"Our Heritage\" size=\"100\" }}\n\nSouthwestern Oregon has always been a wonderful place to live. Wherever you go in the region, you’re probably walking where our ancestors lived their lives, gathered their food, and buried the remains of their loved ones.\n\nOur tribe works closely with anthropologists and archeologists to research the ancestral past. Major archaeological projects have been conducted along the Coquille River and on the bluffs and shorelines of Oregon’s South Coast. This research shows that humans have used and occupied the lands and resources of the coastal region for thousands of years.\n\nPhysical evidence of our ancestors’ presence is rarely obvious, but artifacts and graves lie beneath many well-used local places. Just like anyone else, we feel heartsick when our ancestors’ resting places are violated.\n\nOregon law prohibits vandalizing or excavating cultural resource sites and removing artifacts, whether you’re on public or private land. Please, give our deceased family members the same respect you would give your own.\n\nOur Lands\ndiv class=\"float-right-400px\"\npimg src=\"/img/coquille-sign-04.jpg\" alt=\"The Coquilles Land\" width=\"100%\"\n/pp\nimg src=\"/img/coquille-forest-05.jpg\" alt=\"The Tribal Heritage - The Coquilles Forest\" width=\"100%\"/p\n/div\n\nUnder a 1996 law, the Coquille Tribe resumed stewardship of 5,410 acres of our ancestral homeland. The Coquille Tribal Forest comprises 14 parcels of timber land in eastern Coos County. The tribe acquired the 3,200-acre Sek-wet-se Forest in Curry County in 2015. \n\nForest revenue is a crucial element of the tribe’s annual budget, supporting health care, education and elder services. Our timber harvest generates approximately 200 jobs for the local community, and up to 3.6 million board feet of timber each year for local mills. The tribe uses innovative forestry management to operate in compliance with the Forest Stewardship Council’s stringent certification requirements.\n\nAnother 1,100-acre parcel near Empire is home to Kilkich, a community recognized as a model for attractive, livable reservation housing. The same parcel includes the Empire Forest, home to Fourth Creek and Tarheel Reservoirs. The tribe also owns commercial property in North Bend and Medford.\n\n Contact Us\n\nCoquille Indian Tribe\\\n3050 Tremont Ave, North Bend, Oregon, 97459\\\n(541) 756-0904\n\nFurther details are at a href=\"http://www.coquilletribe.org\" target=\"_blank\"www.coquilletribe.org/a.\n",

Soon you’ll pass the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, a teaching and research extension of the University of Oregon, and Coos Head, which offers a fascinating look at the mouth of this dynamic estuary. Driving south, you’ll reach Bastendorff Beach County Park, a popular surfing spot.\n\n Out to Cape Arago\n\nA series of beautiful state parks awaits you on this stretch of the Route. First stop is Sunset Bay State Park, which features a beach surrounded by sandstone cliffs that shield this favorite swimming cove from the strongest winds and waves. Three mile farther on you’ll reach Shore Acres State Park, which rests upon a bluff that offers sweeping views of the Pacific. The Park was once the site of a grand estate built by lumber baron, Louis B. Simpson; the restored five acre gardens of the Simpson estate, filled with exotic plants from around the world, are open to the public. The road ends at Cape Arago State Park, poised 200 feet above the Pacific. Watch for seals and sea lions in the surf near Simpson Reef, and for migrating whales farther off the coast in the winter. To reach the next leg of the Route, retrace your route for six miles and then turn right on Seven Devils Road.\n\nDown to the Lighthouse\n\nDriving south, you’ll come to the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, home to many important species including bald eagles, great blue herons, elk and Dungeness crab; it also offers a number of great hiking and paddling trails. A little farther along, you’ll pass some of Bandon’s celebrated cranberry bogs (Bandon is, after all, the unofficial cranberry capital of the Pacific Northwest). Anchoring the southern leg of the Route is the Coquille River Lighthouse, one of Oregon’s most photographed landmarks. The Route skirts the Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge before going along the edge of Old Town Bandon. The southern end of the Route traces the scenic drive along the cliff, with stunning views of sea stacks and surf.\n\n Want more details?\n\nOrder a free a href=\"https://traveloregon.com/travel-guides/\" target=\"blank\" Oregon Scenic Byways/a guide, or view a map of the a href=\"http://www.journalgraphicsdigitalpublications.com/epubs/MEDIAMERICA/ScenicByWaysGuide2016/viewer/desktop/#page/58\" target=\"blank\"Charleston to Bandon Tour Route/a online.

The City of Marshfield was named after the Massachusetts home town of the Cityʼs founder, J.C. Tolman, and incorporated in 1874.\n\nDownload a printable Brochure and Map Here: _Historic Walking Tour of Coos Bay_.\n\nThe waterfront was the focus of Marshfield, with Front Street where there are now various larger industrial uses and office buildings, being a hub of pedestrian and waterfront activity.\n\nWhile taking this walking tour, you will note that many of the buildings in the central district of Coos Bay were completed near the turn of the century. This was a time of growth for the community.\n\nThe City of Coos Bay is now made up of various communities that once surrounded the Bay, the oldest of these being Empire City, which was once the Coos County seat. Another community which makes up Coos Bay was until recent years the City of Eastside. Both Empire and Eastside are now districts of Coos Bay. The prominence of these and other individual communities and districts within the city of Coos Bay give it a unique character not often found in small town. Today Coos Bay is known throughout the world as a major exporter of wood products, as the largest city on the Oregon Coast, a center of culture and museums, and a playground for tourists and retirees. It and is the professional and financial hub of the region.\n\nHERE ARE JUST A FEW OF OUR HISTORIC POINTS OF INTEREST.\n\nSee a full list of historic properties on our printable brochure, or pick up a copy at the Coos Bay Visitor Center.\n\n The Egyptian Theatre, 229 South Broadway\n\nOutstanding example of Egyptian Revival Architecture, made popular by the discovery of King Tutankhamuʼs tomb.

        "content": "BRIEF HISTORY OF NORTH BEND\n\nAsa Simpson – sea captain, shipbuilder, lumber- man – built a sawmill and shipyard in the mid 1850’s at the north bend of the Coos Bay. Most famous of the 55 vessels built here (1858-1903) was the Western Shore, a 3-masted “Oregon clipper” that sailed between Portland and Liverpool in a record time of 101 days in 1876.\n\nLouis Simpson, Asa’s 21-year-old son, took over management in 1899. He purchased the townsite of Yarrow, added it to his father’s lands and incorporated the City of North Bend in 1903. His goal was to imitate San Francisco.\n\nIsolated by difficult terrain, the citizens relied on the waterways to carry cargo and passengers to points on the bay or sloughs. Ocean-going ships navigated the treacherous Coos Bay bar to access other ports.\n\nNearly 10,000 citizens now live in “the city that believes in itself.” The future may differ from the past, but North Benders remain proud of their town and history.\n\nStop by our _North Bend Information Center_ to pick up a walking map of the area to explore our historic points of interest.\n\nListed below are just a few of our many points of interest.\n\nMcCULLOUGH BRIDGE (1936) Last of five coast bridges to complete the Roosevelt Highway (US 101). It was a depression era WPA project, costing more than  $2,000,000, employed hundreds, has a length of 5,888 feet, a center height of 150 feet. Originally Coos Bay Bridge, renamed 1947 for its designer Conde B. McCullough.\n\nSIMPSON PARK Part of land bought by Asa M. Simpson in 1855. Simpson heirs deeded to the city about 50 acres in 1916. Property divided by Hwy 101 completion in 1936. Considered city park from earliest days of North Bend (1903). Site of early ball field. Used as auto camp 1920’s-1940’s. Variety of old conifers including sequoia. See also Ferry Road Park.\n\nCITY SIGN OVER HIGHWAY 101 (1936) One of last legal neon signs over state highway and source of local pride. Note that the supports are reminiscent of McCullough Bridge.\n\nMERCI BOXCAR (1949) Narrow gauge French rail car known as “forty & eight” from use in World War 1 to carry 40 men or 8 horses. In appreciation for U.S. aid after WWII French people gave each state a decorated gift-filled car. Oregon’s came to North Bend 2006. Restored by American Legion’s “Forty & Eight” Society.\n\nECKHOFF BUILDING site (pre 1900) Town pioneer did combination home and commercial building in “San Francisco’s Victorian style,” reflecting California’s influence on many early structures. (Now car sales lot.)\n\nHOTEL NORTH BEND (1922) Designed by J.E. Tour- tellotte, was grandest building in city, concrete lessened fire danger, provided 68 rooms, most modern conveniences, dining facility. Vern Gorst met here with national air line executives in 1930, suggested and helped form United Air Lines. First National Bank of North Bend (Sherman/Virginia) closed temporarily 1933-34, city minted myrtlewood money during crisis. (After remodeling, reopened 2009 as housing com- plex with two storefronts.)\n\nWHOLESALE GROCERY WAREHOUSE (1906) Only remaining building of early bustling waterfront, wooden structure on pilings. Many uses – fish cannery, building supply area, ticket office for Breakwater, steamer that sailed Portland – San Francisco route. (Now Kyle Building.)\n\nWATERFRONT (early 1900’s) Boardwalk gives view of area once busy industrial hub of city with shipping, fishing, and passenger ship activity, also mills, factories, shipyards, related ventures. Pilings for city dock still visible. Gorst flew passengers in hydroplane to Marsh- field (Coos Bay) starting 1913, could have been America’s first actual air route, but no written schedule printed.\n\nSOUTHERN PACIFIC TRAIN DEPOT site (1916) After railway bridge over Coos Bay, passenger service began to Willamette Valley and beyond, typical wooden terminal, separate waiting rooms for men and women. Rail service ended 1953, building demolished 1962. (Now State offices)\n\nWINSOR BUILDING (c. 1903) Often called Castle building because of grandeur and Castle Restaurant in first floor corner.

        "content": "_Sunset Bay is haven of sorts. It’s a bay inside a bay with layers of transitional water just a short distance from the open ocean. (Photo credit: Andrew Insinga)_\n\n“Any other place, and this day would be a bust,” says Roy Marcum, organizer of the Angler of the Day Challenge kayak fishing tournament. “But this place is special.” He’s talking about the unique geography of a href=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dspparkPage&parkId=70\" target=\"blank\"Sunset Bay State Park/a on the Southern Oregon Coast. And he’s right.\n\nI was up early one summer morning with 40 other kayak anglers launching from a calm corner of the bay for the tournament. More experienced kayakers had already tested the waters offshore and were returning with reports of big seas. My pulse raced as I pounded into the first small rollers — foretellers of the larger ones ahead.\n\nLuckily, Sunset Bay is a haven of sorts. It’s a bay inside a bay with layers of transitional water just a short distance from the open ocean. My confidence grew as I eased westward, and I found plenty of fishy water behind the protection of Qochyax Island. Occasionally, I felt bold enough to push myself out into open waters where some of the more experienced kayakers were shouting “Yee haw!” on the radio and calling out about a kayak fishing rodeo. I soon retreated back to more protected waters, and Sunset Bay didn’t mind at all. It’s just that kind of place.\n\nKayak fishing in Oregon is enjoying a surge in popularity. Beginners and families can find a friendly learning curve with a slow troll for trout or casting for bass on one of Oregon’s scenic lakes. Others follow salmon runs or sturgeon migrations along Oregon’s rivers (and some might experience the unique kayak fishing “sleigh” ride — hooking a fish so big that it actually drags your boat around). A growing number of adept kayak anglers head offshore into the ocean in search of cabezon, lingcod and the highly prized halibut.\n\nAnd while a well-designed fishing kayak and specialized gear is available and encouraged, it certainly isn’t required. Armed with the proper fishing license and invasive species permit, any old ’yak can do the job. Kayak modifications and creative equipment are all part of the fun. The one constant of the kayak fishing community, however, is a deep dedication to safety. Proper safety gear and training is a common theme across the kayak angling spectrum.\n\nIf you’re trying out kayak fishing on the South Coast, you can rent gear at a href=\"http://www.surfwaxers.com\" target=\"_blank\"Waxer’s Surf Shop/a in Coos Bay. For offshore fishing, beginners will find a relatively easy launch behind the protection of the sandstone cliffs of Sunset Bay State Park. Slow trolling for chinook salmon can be a rewarding workout on the Umpqua, Coos or Coquille rivers. And if a calm lake calls your name, head to nearby Woahink, Siltcoos or Ten Mile lakes for bass, trout and perch.\n\nThe Angler of the Day tournament takes place in late August at Sunset Bay State Park. In July, the Oregon Rockfish Classic, a Hobie Fishing World’s Tournament, occurs out of Depoe Bay with more than 100 of the best kayak anglers in the Northwest. And the yearlong Angler of the Year tournament lets you fish anywhere you choose in the northwest giving you points for your biggest fish in 10 different categories. Find out more about these tournaments and other tips on kayak angling at a href=\"http://www.northwestkayakanglers.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=400494abee581f190d6ecd8cb85ff9c5;wwwRedirect\" target=\"_blank\"NorthwestKayakAnglers.com/a.\n\nMy single black rockfish did not make me the angler of the day that day. But Sunset Bay made me feel like a winner. I ventured out and challenged myself on a day that would have been a bust anywhere else. This place is special indeed.\n\nSourced from a href=\"https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/paddle-sports/kayaking/kayak-fishing-on-the-south-coast/\" target=\"blank\"TravelOregon.com/a._\n",

While here, it is worth exploring the different types of fishing, from shore, charter boat, bridge, and even kayak. Here are a few tips for your next fishing excursion.\n\nMost Pacific salmon fishing occurs April through November, and sport seasons are regulated for Coho and Chinook salmon by state and federal agencies. Check with the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife for the most up to date a href=\"https://myodfw.com/recreation-report\" target=\"_blank\"recreation report/a and also check with tackle and bait shops for local information about specific seasons, catch limits and conditions.\n\nHalibut is a spring and early summer fishery, while Albacore Tuna tend to be offshore from mid-summer through early fall. Bottomfish are available year around – weather permitting – and a charter trip usually ends with an ice chest full of fish. Check the a href=\"https://myodfw.com/fishing\" target=\"_blank\"ODF&W website/a or the Charleston field office (541-888-5515) for bottomfish catch limits.\n\nOregon’s Adventure Coast also offers several unique fisheries; a href=\"https://myodfw.com/articles/how-fish-surfperch\" target=\"_blank\"surf fishing/a from local beaches for striped bass and surf perch and in-bay fishing for White sturgeon. Popular locations for surf fishing include Horsfall Beach, Bastendorff Beach and Cape Arago State Park. The best information about these fishing opportunities is available from local tackle shops.\n\n**Please note, whenever surf fishing, consult tidal charts, weather conditions and beware that sneaker waves occur on the Oregon Coast. Never turn your back on the ocean.**\n\nCharter Boat Companies\n\nBetty Kay Charters\\\n90389 Albacore Ave\\\nCharleston, OR\\\n(541) 888-9021\\\na href=\"http://www.bettykaycharters.com\" target=\"_blank\"www.BettyKayCharters.com/a\n\nPacific Charter Services\\\nOcean & Bay fishing and crabbing trips\\\n63480 Crossline Road\\\nCharleston, OR  97420\\\n(541) 378-3040\\\na href=\"http://www.pacificcharterservices.com\" target=\"_blank\"www.PacificCharterServices.com/a\n\nSharkys Charters\\\n6440 Bruce Road\\\nCharleston, OR  97420\\\n(541) 260-9110\\\na href=\"http://www.SharkysCharterFfishing.com\" target=\"_blank\"www.sharkyscharterfishing.com/a\n",

Watch waves crashing at Shore Acres, visit museums or catch a show at a local theater, tackle the Oregon Dunes or roll the dice at The Mill Casino. Here are some ideas to start planning your wintercation in Oregon’s Adventure Coast:\n\nFishing and Crabbing\n\nIn the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area, there’s a fish for every season and a seemingly endless choice of prime fishing spots. Steelhead, crabbing and clamming are the superstars in the winter months, while spring is all about salmon, surf perch and bass. Come year-round by boat, by foot, by kayak or by charters and guides.\n\n Storm Watching\n\nOregonians know it as storm watching, but it could really be called wave watching. The formation of the cliffs at a href=\"https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dspparkPage&parkId=68\" target=\"blank\"Shore Acres State Park/a meet with the mighty Pacific Ocean to create 100-foot waves that are a photographer and ocean lover’s dream.\n\nCoast Culture\n\nTake in a show at The Liberty Theatre, home of the a href=\"http://thelibertytheatre.org\" target=\"blank\"Little Theatre on the Bay/a or the a href=\"http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com\" target=\"blank\"Egyptian Theatre/a, visit unique museums and experience the rich artistic culture and maritime history of the Oregon Coast.\n\n Ride On\n\nThere’s no place on earth like the Oregon Dunes. Wind-sculpted dunes tower up to 500 feet above sea level and stretch forty miles for non-stop fun. See for yourself why thousands come to our dunes for the thrill of the ride. Adrenaline junkies can rent their own quad, while nature lovers can take a guided tour.\n\nHit a Strike or Strike it Rich\n\nSmall towns aren’t without big thrills: the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area is home to a href=\"http://northbendlanes.com\" target=\"blank\"North Bend Lanes/a, where you can Cosmic Bowl on a stormy winter evening.  a href=\"https://www.themillcasino.com\" target=\"blank\"The Mill Casino • Hotel & RV Park/a and a href=\"https://www.threeriverscasino.com/coos-bay-casino\" target=\"_blank\"Three Rivers Coos Bay/a offer non-stop casino action just waiting for you.

Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston have a bounty of incredible fishing options, so we asked a local expert where fishermen can go to find the best winter steelhead fishing.\n\nWe checked with Gary Vonderohe, a Fish Biologist with the a href=\"https://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/\" target=\"_blank\"Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife/a in Charleston, who shares his tips and recommendations below to help you plan your winter steelhead fishing trip to Coos Bay!\n\nTo learn more, you can always check with the a href=\"https://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/\" target=\"_blank\"Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife/a for the most up to date recreation report and visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast for a list of local bait and tackle shops.  Visit our website to learn about more fresh water fishing options in Coos Bay.\n\nTOP PICKS FOR STEELHEAD RIVERS ON THE SOUTH COAST\n\nCOOS RIVER\n\nIn the Coos River basin winter steelhead fishing typically starts the week of Thanksgiving. We have hatchery steelhead acclimation sites on the West Fork Millicoma River, East Fork Millicoma River, and South Fork Coos River. Fishing on the West Fork and East Fork Millicoma rivers are best in December through mid-February. Fishing on the South Fork Coos River is best from December through March. There is good fishing access at the Millicoma Interpretive Center on the West Fork Millicoma River and Nesika Park is a good place to fish for steelhead on the East Fork Millicoma River. Access to fish the South Fork Coos River is through Weyerhaeuser property and a permit is needed.\n\nCOQUILLE RIVER\n\nIn the Coquille River basin winter steelhead fishing starts the last week of November. There are hatchery steelhead acclimation sites on the North Fork (LaVerne Park) and South Fork (Woodward and Beaver creeks) Coquille rivers. The best months to fish the North Fork Coquille River are December through February with excellent access on foot at LaVerne Park. The South Fork Coquille River is an excellent river to be fished by boat. There are multiple access points to launch drift boats. Some of these access points are good areas to fish from the bank. The South Fork fishes well from December through April with the best fishing lower in the river early in the season.  As part of a coastwide conservation plan, hatchery steelhead releases were discontinued on the East Fork Coquille after 2014.  The East Fork Coquille River is open to harvest of wild steelhead (1 per day and 3 per year) and hatchery steelhead from the mouth up to Brewster Gorge. The best months to fish the East Fork Coquille are January through early March.\n\nTENMILE/EEL CREEK\n\nFishing for winter steelhead in Tenmile Creek starts in late December with the best fishing in January through late February. Best fishing in Eel Creek is from January through March. There are three hatchery steelhead acclimation sites, one at Saunders Creek at Spinreel Park, one at Eel Creek in Tugman State Park, and the third is on a small stream in between Eel Creek and Spinreel Park. There is excellent boat and foot access on Tenmile Creek at Spinreel Park and good foot access at the mouth of Eel Creek. There are a few access points to Eel Creek but it is accessible by foot traffic only. Eel Creek is very brushy and the pools that hold steelhead are small.\n\nGARY’S WINTER STEELHEAD FISHING TIPS\n\nOne of the most popular techniques for fishing steelhead on all three river systems is to drift eggs or corkies along the stream bottom through holding water\nAnother technique becoming popular is to drift a jig under a bobber\nFly fishing is another way to catch steelhead with an egg pattern drifted under a strike indicator being the most popular technique. Swinging flies through a run can also produce a bite\nEach steelhead season from December 1 through April 30, steelhead anglers will be able to keep an additional adipose fin- clipped steelhead per day for a total aggregate of 3 adult fish harvested daily in the Coos, Coquille, and Tenmile basins",
