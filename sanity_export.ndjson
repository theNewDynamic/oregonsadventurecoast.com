Our intermediate ride is great for enthusiastic riders and those with trail riding experience who want to ride a little faster, but still not get left behind. We will ride at a decent pace enjoying a longer ride on mostly blue (intermediate) and green trails with plenty of stops at crucial intersections to hydrate, chat, and catch your breath. This ride, guided by local enthusiasts, is perfect for those with basic to intermediate mountain biking skills who may not be ready for the entire system but want a good solid ride with good solid people.","_key":"fd98f61ecc2d3"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"2d91da8b67ef","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Beginner Ride - Saturday","_key":"2d91da8b67ef0"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"\n","_key":"2d91da8b67ef1"},{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"11:30 AM Beginner Ride","_key":"2d91da8b67ef2"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"\nBreak the Ice: Easy, no-drop ride for adults. 5+/- miles.

This relaxed-paced ride is open for beginner mountain bikers who want to get a taste of the trails at an easy pace, so you don't need to feel like you're always having to “keep up.” This ride will venture on both the East and West sides of Whiskey Run and encompass white (very easy), green (easy) and a little bit of blue (intermediate) trails. This no-drop ride will give you a chance to enjoy some of the best of the trails and trees with not too much climbing or difficulty, and plenty of breaks. This group ride is perfect for new-to-mountain biking riders who want a supportive and fun atmosphere to learn new skills.","_key":"8f44fde9eec31"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"7cc009ae7691","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"11:30 AM Beginner Ride","_key":"7cc009ae76910"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" gathers and grouped by ability & experience.","_key":"7cc009ae76911"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal","level":1,"listItem":"bullet"},{"_key":"0396b9fc7f36","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"11:45 AM Beginner Ride","_key":"0396b9fc7f360"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" leaves led by local enthusiasts.","_key":"0396b9fc7f361"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal","level":1,"listItem":"bullet"},{"_type":"pt.spacer","size":2,"_key":"2add28208412"},{"_key":"289651edff37","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Family Ride:","_key":"289651edff370"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" Sippy Cup- Family-Friendly Ride (~3 miles).
