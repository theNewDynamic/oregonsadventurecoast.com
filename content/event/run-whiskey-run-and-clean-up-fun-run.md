### RUN WHISKEY RUN!!

If you have ever wanted to take to the trails at Whiskey Run, but not on a mountain bike, this is your chance!

The **<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://southcoastrunningclub.org/">South Coast Running Club</a>** invites runners for this one-of-a-kind run through our now famous, single-track, top-rated, mountain biking trail system - cardoned off specifically for runners for this race.

The run will start and finish at the main **Whiskey Run Trailhead**. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=Whiskey+Run+Mountain+Biking+Trail+Parking,+E+Humphreys+Rd,+Bandon,+OR+97411&amp;ftid=0x54c4818dc596de61:0xe64719ece591060f&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=us&amp;entry=gps&amp;g_ep=CAIYAQ%3D%3D&amp;shorturl=1">Trailhead location&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;

Our chosen section of Whiskey Run is shaded and sheltered, which means these trails are rolling, smooth, and oh so loamy.

#### **Course options include the following:**&nbsp;&nbsp;

*Note that projected distances and actual distances may vary, kinda like the amount of whiskey consumption you report to your doctor! &nbsp;These maps also don’t start at the parking lot, which you will, so show up a little short.*

* **1\.5 Mile (Shirley Temple)**
  * A shorter loop, but still challenging. Great for walkers and adventurous families wishing to wet their whistles!

* **5 Mile (Whiskey Ginger)**
  * A full loop on super-premium top-shelf trails, cheers!
  * <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.trailforks.com/ridelog/planner/view/333049/">Whiskey Ginger Map</a>
* **10 Mile (Double Shot)**
  * If one just isn’t enough, imbibe 2 full loops – stay thirsty, my friends!

*Please note that all courses are 100% trail, so not stroller friendly. &nbsp;These are single-track trails and a dog can take you out. &nbsp;We love dogs, but please leave your dog at home!*
