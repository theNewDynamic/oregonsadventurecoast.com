Don’t miss the Oregon Coast’s **largest fireworks display** on July 3rd. [The Mill Casino ](https://www.themillcasino.com/)will light up the skies over the Bay with this year's waterfront fireworks display. 

**The fireworks display will be located in front of The Mill Casino, but can be seen from just about anywhere along the Bay!**

**The 20-minute fireworks show commences at 10pm** and will be synchronized to music on K-DOCK radio.  Tune in to [K-DOCK radio 92.9 fm](https://kdockfm.com/) for the live remote and firework display broadcast!
