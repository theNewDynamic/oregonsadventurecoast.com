## The 2019 Lineup include:

**BARN DOOR SLAMMERS** – This 7-piece swing band is recreating the music that filled American dance halls in the ’40s and ’50s.  Inspired by the great western dance bands of Bob Wills, Tex Williams, Spade Cooley, and Billy Jack Wills!

**DAVE BENNETT QUARTET** – This powerhouse band enthralls audiences with toe-tapping swing, moody blues, and emotional ballads, all performed with deft touch, virtuosity, and style. Not only does the quartet feature music from the Swing era, but they also touch on country, rockabilly and pop, with original brand-new jazz compositions thrown in. Audiences will hear the influences of Benny Goodman, Pete Fountain, Jerry Lee Lewis, even Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel in this group’s music.

**BAY CITY SWING** – Formerly Evolution of The Oregon Coast Lab Band, Bay City Swing is comprised of former Evolution members along with a few new faces. Still associated with the Oregon Coast Lab Band, Bay City Swing is a collaboration of all the musicians in the band. Officially starting in early July 2017, Bay City Swing has very quickly made an impact in Oregon’s Bay Area and the festival world. The band has a Big Band feel and Crooner styling that swing across many decades.

**GATOR NATION** – The West Coast’s premiere Cajun, Zydeco, and New Orleans R&B band, is a hand-clapping, foot-stomping, high energy concert and dance band. With the same survival instinct as its namesake, Gator Nation continues to adapt itself to its audiences, always with something fresh yet true to its calling. That calling is to represent the music of South Louisiana in all its forms, Cajun, Zydeco, and New Orleans style.

**GOOD CO.** – As the United States’ first Electro Swing Band, Good Co is proud to present this new genre to hep cats everywhere. Pounding dance beats are mixed with gypsy jazz guitar riffs, samples from the past turned on their head along with a live horn section make for the best sounding dance party this side of the 1920s.

**GINO & THE LONE GUNMEN** – Featuring a rockin’ mix of ROCKABILLY, SWING, BLUES, COUNTRY, and Vintage ROCK and ROLL.  Their song catalog includes rockin and swingin original music, as well as all your favorites, including everything from Elvis and Buddy Holly to the Cavern Club days of the Beatles! The Lone Gunmen have shared the stage with many other great bands such as Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Slim Jim Phantom(Stray Cats), Three Bad Jacks, Big Sandy and more, and after making their debut at the 2012 Viva Las Vegas festival, the band has been quickly gaining more and more fans from around the world!

**LISA MANN** – This super talented musician has been awarded the prestigious 2016 Blues Music Award for her mighty skills on the bass guitar, an award which she also took home in 2015. Her first award win fell hot on the heels of her win for Blues Blast’s Sean Costello Rising Star Award, as well as three Muddy Waters Awards from the Cascade Blues Association for Contemporary Blues Act of the Year, Bass Player of the Year, and Northwest Recording of the Year. Her latest release, Hard Times, Bad Decisions debuted on the Living Blues radio chart at #7, and on the International Blues Broadcasters Association chart at #10, and can be heard burning up the airwaves worldwide.

**PHAT CAT SWINGER**  – Founding members Marco Palos and Will Pattinson teamed up to create and refine the Phat Cat sound.  Booming toms, jumpin’ rhythms, and a powerful horn section blended with the sweet vocals of Curtis Parry were all the perfect ingredients for their creation.  It became known as “Phat Cat Swinger” a West Coast “little-big” band that specializing in high-energy music with a vintage touch!

**ROYAL JELLY JIVE** – Few bands have the ability to evoke an old-school throwback vibe and yet sound entirely fresh and new at the same time. Royal Jelly Jive is one of those bands. Combining elements of Soul, Rock, Swing and Hip-Hop, Royal Jelly Jive shakes up every dance-party and grooves harder than your typical rock n’ roll band dares to go. It is all fronted by enigmatic singer Lauren Bjelde, whose sultry voice and songwriting lands somewhere in-between Amy Winehouse and Tom Waits.

**DAVE STUCKEY & THE HOT HOUSE GANG** – This band is a hard-swinging, take-no-prisoners aggregation, playing the standards and not-so-standards from the 1920’s & 30s …and whose main objective is to bring the heat, get you out of your seat, and provoke you to move your feet. Bringing with him a Murderer’s Row of torrid trad jazz operators from the wilds of Los Angeles, Stuckey’s outfit channels an Eddie Condon small-group drive with jiving vocals that may conjure thoughts of Wingy Manone or Fats Waller.

**THE YOUNG BUCS** – Whether it’s Gene Chandler’s “Duke of Earl” or “Little Darlin”, made famous by The Diamonds, THE YOUNG BUCS Doo-Wop division take you back to the ‘50’s, and the days before IPods and cell phones. The Young Bucs may take you back to the ’50s, but having been a teen during that era is not a prerequisite to enjoying this music.  The style and themes of the music from the doo-wop era are classic and timeless. Audiences of all ages continue to be entertained as The Young Bucs bring it to life.
