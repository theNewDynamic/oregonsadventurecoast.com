### Rare ‘Ring of Fire’ Eclipse: First Landfall on Our Beaches!

If you’re planning to visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston the 2nd weekend in October, you’re in for a special treat! If you haven’t heard, parts of the Western United States will experience an annular solar eclipse &nbsp;this fall (a.k.a. “Ring of Fire” event)! Sky-watchers from all over the region can experience the big show on Oregon’s Adventure Coast at 9:18 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on Saturday, October 14, 2023. In fact, we will be among the first in the U.S. to see it before it continues to move southeast towards Texas, Central America and South America.

**What is it like Inside the Path of an Annular Solar Eclipse?**

According to [<u>the website, Great American Eclipse</u>](https://www.greatamericaneclipse.com), “an annular solar eclipse promises a spectacular vision featuring the striking sight of the Sun as a ring.” Those inside the path of the 2023 Annular Solar Eclipse will see the sun appear as a bright ring-shaped halo around the edges of the moon for a full 4 minutes before it continues southeast. Daylight will be noticeably dimmer, but viewers will not experience complete darkness like a total solar eclipse.

**What Causes the Dramatic Ring of Fire?**
