#### FAQ:

**What is the capacity of the rink?** The rink is maxed at 70 people.

**What are the Restrictions?** All youth under age 14 must have a guardian present to access the ice skating rink.

**Don't own ice skates?** No problem. You can rent a pair at the rink.

**Have your own ice skates?** Cool! You get to skate for free as long as there is capacity on the rink.

**Worried about the weather?** No need! The rink is under a huge tent and shielded from the wind on both the north and south sides by existing buildings!

**Just want to watch others wobble along on thin-bladed skates?** You can do that too. There is seating under the tent! Spectators are encouraged to dress in layers as the rink is very cold.

**About the Rink:** This is a 3,250 sq. ft. synthetic ice skating rink enclosed in a 5,000 sq. ft. event tent. Traditional ice rinks are rare due to the high maintenance cost. Xtraice synthetic ice has been used, which is no ordinary ice. Xtraice uses cutting-edge technology and the highest quality materials with the most significant molecular density in the market. The goal of any synthetic ice is to have the lowest friction coefficient, or “gliding degree,” and good grip. The grip is vital for many ice skating and hockey maneuvers. We offer four polar bears to push around to help with balance to assist young, less skilled skaters.

Stay tuned for special themed nights, including Disco Ice Skating Nights, Movie Ice Skating Nights, Costume Ice Skating Nights, Karaoke Ice Skating Nights, and much more!
