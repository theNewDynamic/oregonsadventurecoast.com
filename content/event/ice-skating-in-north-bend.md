**Don't own ice skates?** No problem. You can rent a pair at the rink.

**Worried about the weather?** No need! The rink is under a huge tent and shielded from the wind on both the north and south sides by existing buildings!

**Just want to watch others wobble along on thin-bladed skates?** You can do that too. There is seating under the tent!

**This newest attraction adds to the festive atmosphere to be found in downtown North Bend this Holiday Season.** For more information on all there is to do this holiday in downtown North Bend, [click here](/event/christmas-at-the-coast/).
