Thanks to the support of the Octoberfish event, the Charleston Seafood Festival is making its long-awaited return this October!

This year’s Octoberfish will feature an incredible lineup of local vendors—including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/7DevilsBrewingCo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 Devils Brewing Co</a>, <a href="https://www.chucksseafood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chuck’s Seafood</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fishermensseafoodmarket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fishermen's Seafood Market</a>, and many more—serving up a variety of seafood delicacies straight from our coastal fisheries.

We’re thrilled to have this beloved tradition back in the community and can’t wait to celebrate with you all. See you there!
