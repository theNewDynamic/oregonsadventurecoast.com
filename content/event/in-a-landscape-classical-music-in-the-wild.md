### IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild™

#### AT SHORE ACRES STATE PARK - September 4 & 5

###### ![](/img/p1320602.jpg)

###### {{< spacer 25 >}}

Founded in 2016 by classical pianist Hunter Noack, [**IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild**](https://www.inalandscape.org/) is an outdoor concert series where America’s most stunning landscapes replace the traditional concert hall. In a Landscape brings a 9-foot Steinway grand piano on a flatbed trailer to National & State Parks, urban greenspaces, working ranches, farms, and historical sites for classical music concerts that connect people with each landscape.

To meet the acoustical challenges of performing in the wild, **music is transmitted to concert-goers via wireless headphones**. No longer confined to seats, concert goers can explore the landscape, wander through the Shore Acres garden, lie in sunny meadows, and roam along the rugged cliffs.

**IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild™ concerts are brought to you in partnership with the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and Sponsors** [**Wild Rivers Coast Alliance**](https://wildriverscoastalliance.com/)**,** [**Travel Southern Oregon Coast**](https://www.oscrtn.com/tsoc.html)**, and** [**Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/)**. This year's recipient of the donations will be Friends of Shore Acres!**

#### **ABOUT THIS LANDSCAPE**

Perched on craggy sandstone cliffs high above the ocean, **Shore Acres State Park** celebrates two sorts of beauty: ruggedly organic and masterfully constructed.

Once the grand estate of timber baron Louis J. Simpson, Shore Acres features a **formal garden inspired by the original, with plants and flowers from all over the world**. Visitors find a Japanese-style garden with a lily pond and two carefully curated rose gardens that include All-American Rose Selections.

**Get here early to explore trails beyond the garden** that lead to a secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach.
