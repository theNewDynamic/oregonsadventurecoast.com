Founded in 2016 by classical pianist Hunter Noack, **IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild** is an outdoor concert series where America’s most stunning landscapes replace the traditional concert hall. We bring a 9-foot Steinway grand piano on a flatbed trailer to National Parks, urban greenspaces, working ranches, farms, and historical sites for classical music concerts that connect people with each landscape.

To meet the acoustical challenges of performing in the wild, music is transmitted to concert-goers via wireless headphones. No longer confined to seats, you can explore the landscape, wander through secret glens, lie in sunny meadows, and roam old-growth forests.

#### **ABOUT THIS LANDSCAPE**

![](/img/dahlias-shore-acres-state-park-blog-695x322-jpg.png)

Perched on craggy sandstone cliffs high above the ocean, **Shore Acres State Park** celebrates two sorts of beauty: ruggedly organic and masterfully constructed.

Once the grand estate of timber baron Louis J. Simpson, Shore Acres features a formal garden inspired by the original, with plants and flowers from all over the world. Visitors find a Japanese-style garden with a lily pond and two carefully curated rose gardens that include All-American Rose Selections. For a schedule of what's in bloom, visit the Friends of Shore Acres website.

Get here early to explore trails beyond the garden that lead to a secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach. And on your way, stop at Sunset Bay State Park, just one mile north of Shore Acres. Sunset Bay offers overnight camping facilities and a sheltered beach. One mile to the south, Cape Arago State Park has hiking trails, picnic tables, and excellent opportunities for viewing tidepool life and the offshore colonies of seals and sea lions on Shell Island and Simpson Reef, part of Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. All three parks are connected by a segment of the Oregon Coast Trail.

**-Thanks to Oregon State Parks for sharing this information.**
