### IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild™

#### AT SHORE ACRES STATE PARK - September 7 & 8 at 6:00pm

###### ![](/img/p1320602.jpg)

###### {{< spacer 25 >}}

Founded in 2016 by classical pianist Hunter Noack, [**IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild**](https://www.inalandscape.org/) is an outdoor concert series where America’s most stunning landscapes replace the traditional concert hall. In a Landscape brings a 9-foot Steinway grand piano on a flatbed trailer to National Parks, urban greenspaces, working ranches, farms, and historical sites for classical music concerts that connect people with each landscape.

To meet the acoustical challenges of performing in the wild, **music is transmitted to concert-goers via wireless headphones**. No longer confined to seats, you can explore the landscape, wander through the Shore Acres garden, lie in sunny meadows, and roam along the rugged cliffs.

**IN A LANDSCAPE: Classical Music in the Wild™ concerts are brought to you in partnership with the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and Sponsors** [**Wild Rivers Coast Alliance**](https://wildriverscoastalliance.com/)**,** [**Travel Southern Oregon Coast**](https://www.oscrtn.com/tsoc.html)**, and** [**Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/)**.**

#### **ABOUT THIS LANDSCAPE**

![](/img/dahlias-shore-acres-state-park-blog-695x322-jpg.png "There is always something blooming in the gardens at Shore Acres State Park!")

Perched on craggy sandstone cliffs high above the ocean, **Shore Acres State Park** celebrates two sorts of beauty: ruggedly organic and masterfully constructed.

Once the grand estate of timber baron Louis J. Simpson, Shore Acres features a **formal garden inspired by the original, with plants and flowers from all over the world**. Visitors find a Japanese-style garden with a lily pond and two carefully curated rose gardens that include All-American Rose Selections.

**Get here early to explore trails beyond the garden** that lead to a secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach.
