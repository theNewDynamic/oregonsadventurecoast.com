### Two days of fun biking events on the Southern Oregon Coast!

{{< spacer 50 >}}

**Advanced Enduro Style Ride** - Full Flight Enduro: (\~20 miles). Ready to really take flight? Exceptional guided ride for those looking for both miles and hang time, while lapping all the fun downhill-only trails. Take a tour with our local shredders around black and double black jump trails with blue and green climbing in between. This ride is great for those more experienced riders looking to hit the jumps, gaps, and techy fall-line trails all around Whiskey Run. Get your climbing legs ready for this up and down enduro-style ride. Options for pre-ride, re-ride and rip on more challenging features. Bring your hydration and fuel for this longer ride.

Are you looking to push your mileage at a good pace with fellow stoked riders, but not looking to fly through the air just yet? The “advanced ride” is for those who want to keep their wheels (mostly) on the ground and are comfortable on a longer ride at a faster pace. You definitely won’t be racing, but this ride is for those that are confident enough to keep up and enjoy the best of the trail system on all level trails from Green to Black. Guided by Whiskey Run gurus, you will ride in and out of the trees, up and down the slopes, and really get a good taste of what Whiskey has to offer!

The intermediate ride is great for enthusiastic riders and those with trail riding experience who want to ride a little faster, but still not get left behind. You will ride at a decent pace, enjoying a longer ride on mostly blue (intermediate) and green trails with plenty of stops at crucial intersections to hydrate, chat, and catch your breath. This ride, guided by local enthusiasts, is perfect for those with basic to intermediate mountain biking skills who may not be ready for the entire system, but want a good solid ride with good solid people.

This no-drop ride will give you a chance to enjoy some of the best of the trails and trees with not too much climbing or difficulty, and plenty of breaks.

This route has minimal elevation change and exposure and is great for those just learning trail riding. There will be some pump track time at the end of the ride too.
