### Coos Bay Welcomes Santa for a Tree Lighting and a Screening of the movie "Elf"at the Egyptian Theatre

Join Santa as he lights the 50 foot Christmas Tree in downtown Coos Bay. The event takes place at the Coos Bay Visitor Information Center. Cider and cookies will be served and carols will be sung as visitors await Santa's arrival.

Following the tree lighting is the annual showing of **ELF** at the Historic Egyptian Theatre. Entry to the movie is FREE with a pair of new clean socks for the snowball fight scene. Bring more than one pair to have extra "snowball" throws! Socks will be donated to local shelters after the showing.

**Festivities begin at 5:00pm with the tree lighting at approximately 5:30pm. Head over to the Egyptian Theatre with Santa for pictures.  ELF begins around 7pm. Attendees can walk from Coos Bay Visitor Center to the Egyptian Theatre.**
