![32nd Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres](/img/holiday-lights-695x322.jpg)

The brightest and most beautiful place on the West Coast shines as brightly as ever in 2019.

Famous for its beautiful 7 acre botanical gardens and Japanese lily pond, Share Acres shines with over a quarter million lights, animated displays, Santa, choirs, and more. A holiday tradition for the whole family.

This festive annual display debuts on Thanksgiving Day (Thursday, November 28th) and will light up Shore Acres from 4 p.m.-9:30 p.m. each night (including Dec 24th & 25th) thru December 31st.
