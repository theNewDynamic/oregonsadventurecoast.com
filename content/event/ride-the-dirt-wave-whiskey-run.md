##### **Bring your Mountain Biking Friends to the South Coast's Premier Mountain Biking Trail, Whiskey Run, for the 2nd of 3 Coast-wide Ride the Dirt Wave Events!**

Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trail System is a purpose-built trail system in the Coos County Forest that winds through loamy, beautiful old-growth evergreens with views of the Pacific Ocean at the trail tops. There’s something for every rider, with trails for all levels from family-friendly/beginner areas to advanced jump lines and Double Black diamond trails.

The trail system is located about 20 min south of Coos Bay via US-101 N and Seven Devils Rd.

This is a great opportunity to come out and get to know the trails in a fun and supportive environment.

The celebration of the trails will include food, music & beverages on site. Food cart and beer from 7 Devils Brewery will be available for purchase.

It’s more than just biking – it’s a celebration of community and adventure on the Southern Oregon Coast! **Two days of fun biking events on the Southern Oregon Coast!**

We definitely won’t be racing, but this ride is for those that are confident enough to keep up and enjoy the best of the trail system on all level trails from Green to Black. Guided by Whiskey Run gurus, you will ride in and out of the trees, up and down the slopes, and really get a good taste of what Whiskey has to offer!

This no-drop ride will give you a chance to enjoy some of the best of the trails and trees with not too much climbing or difficulty, and plenty of breaks.
