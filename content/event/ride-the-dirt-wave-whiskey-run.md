##### **Bring your Mountain Biking Friends to the South Coast's Premier Mountain Biking Trail, Whiskey Run, for the 2nd of 3 Coast-wide Ride the Dirt Wave Events!**

Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trail System is a purpose-built trail system in the Coos County Forest that winds through loamy, beautiful old-growth evergreens with views of the Pacific Ocean at the trail tops. There’s something for every rider, with trails for all levels from family-friendly/beginner areas to advanced jump lines and Double Black diamond trails.

The trail system is located about 20 min south of Coos Bay via US-101 N and Seven Devils Rd.

This is a great opportunity to come out and get to know the trails in a fun and supportive environment.

The celebration of the trails will include food, music & beverages on site. Food cart and beer from 7 Devils Brewery will be available for purchase.

It’s more than just biking – it’s a celebration of community and adventure on the Southern Oregon Coast! **Two days of fun biking events on the Southern Oregon Coast!**
