##### **Bring your Mountain Biking Friends to the South Coast's Premier Mountain Biking Trail, Whiskey Run, for the 2nd of 3 Coast-wide Ride the Dirt Wave Events!**

Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trail System is a purpose-built trail system in the Coos County Forest that winds through loamy, beautiful old-growth evergreens with views of the Pacific Ocean at the trail tops. There’s something for every rider, with trails for all levels from family-friendly/beginner areas to advanced jump lines and Double Black diamond trails.

The trail system is located about 20 min south of Coos Bay via US-101 N and Seven Devils Rd.

This is a great opportunity to come out and get to know the trails in a fun and supportive environment.

The celebration of the trails will include food, music & beverages on site. Food cart and beer from 7 Devils Brewery will be available for purchase.

Don't Miss these two days of fun biking events on the Southern Oregon Coast!

**Advanced Ride**<br>10:30AM - Advanced Cross Country Ride<br>Full Flight: 20+/- miles, Longer, faster-paced no-drop ride for advanced riders. Are you looking to push your mileage at a good pace with fellow stoked riders? The “advanced ride” is for those who want to keep their wheels (mostly) on the ground and are comfortable on a longer ride at a faster pace. We definitely won’t be racing, but this ride is for those that are confident enough to keep up and enjoy the best of the trail system on all level trails from Green to Black. Guided by Whiskey Run gurus, you will ride in and out of the trees, up and down the slopes, and really get a good taste of what Whiskey has to offer!

**Intermediate Ride**<br>11:00AM - Intermediate Ride<br>Whiskey Sampler: No-drop ride on green and blue trails. 10+/- miles. Ready for a little more, but not yet ready to be the King/Queen of the Mountain? Our intermediate ride is great for enthusiastic riders and those with trail riding experience who want to ride a little faster, but still not get left behind. We will ride at a decent pace enjoying a longer ride on mostly blue (intermediate) and green trails with plenty of stops at crucial intersections to hydrate, chat, and catch your breath. This ride, guided by local enthusiasts, is perfect for those with basic to intermediate mountain biking skills who may not be ready for the entire system but want a good solid ride with good solid people.

**Beginner Ride**<br>11:30AM - Beginner Ride<br>Break the Ice: Easy, no-drop ride for adults. 5+/- miles. This relaxed-paced ride is open for beginner mountain bikers who want to get a taste of the trails at an easy pace, so you don’t need to feel like you’re always having to “keep up.” This ride will venture on both the East and West sides of Whiskey Run and encompass white (very easy), green (easy), and a little bit of blue (intermediate) trails. This no-drop ride will give you a chance to enjoy some of the best of the trails and trees with not too much climbing or difficulty, and plenty of breaks. This group ride is perfect for new-to-mountain biking riders who want a supportive and fun atmosphere to learn new skills.
