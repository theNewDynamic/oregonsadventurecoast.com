#### Shore Acres will be dark this year, but residents and businesses all over Oregon's Adventure Coast will light up the night sky to show our holiday spirit!

From **Thanksgiving night to New Year's Eve 2020**, neighborhoods and business districts will light up for the holidays. Pick up a map from the Coos Bay and North Bend Visitor Information Centers and delight to the sights of Christmas as you drive around our beautiful communities.

When you visit and stay at one of our lodging properties, bring your receipt to either visitor center to receive a special commemorative, dated ornament!

**More Information Coming Soon!**
