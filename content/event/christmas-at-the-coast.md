#### November 28th to December 21st<br>[**Reindeer Roundup**]()

Ruckus, the Reindeer, has convinced Santa’s reindeer to explore downtown instead of going back to the north pole following Santa’s visit. The reindeer will be hiding in businesses downtown. Find the reindeer in participating businesses, take a picture and then fill out an entry form to be entered to win a grand prize. (Business hours vary) The event will end on December 21st when the reindeer will return to the north pole to help Santa deliver toys to children around the world.

After the tree lighting, Star of Hope will once again be opening their doors for families to come in, have refreshments, visit personally with Santa, and vote in the gingerbread house competition.
