#### November 28th to December 21st<br>[**Reindeer Roundup**]()

Ruckus, the Reindeer, has convinced Santa’s reindeer to explore downtown instead of going back to the north pole following Santa’s visit. The reindeer will be hiding in businesses downtown. Find the reindeer in participating businesses, take a picture and then fill out an entry form to be entered to win a grand prize. (Business hours vary) The event will end on December 21st when the reindeer will return to the north pole to help Santa deliver toys to children around the world.

#### {{< floatimage src="img//img/Tree-Lighting-coosbay-340x214.jpg.jpg" float="left" alt="Lighted Tree" size="40" >}} December 2nd <br>Empire District Tree Lighting and Santa Parade

The Empire District of Coos Bay will hold their annual Tree Lighting at 5:30pm, and will also live stream it on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Community-Coalition-of-Empire-CCE-110984147408194). Before the lighting, Santa will be riding through the streets in the Empire District - from 3:30-5:30pm - on top of the Empire fire engine as his elves hand out goodies to all the good little children in Empire. After the tree lighting, Star of Hope will once again be opening their doors for families to come in, have refreshments, visit personally with Santa, and vote in the gingerbread house competition. Each Star of Hope team will design and build a gingerbread house entry and the most votes will determine this year's winner.
