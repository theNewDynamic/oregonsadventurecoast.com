Join your friends from Oregon's Adventure Coast for a feast of delicious Dungeness Crab! Fresh Dungeness crab dinners - whole or half crabs at market price - include side dishes, bread, beverage and cake. Area businesses provide items for the raffle. Projected prices are $20 for whole crab dinner and $16 for half crab dinner, but market dictates final price. Pricing will be updated as event approaches.

**Note Location in North Bend!** The North Bend Community Center, 2222 Broadway Ave. All proceeds help support the Charleston Visitor Center.
