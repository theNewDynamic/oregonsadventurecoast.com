Coos Bay is home to the longest running music festival on the Oregon Coast! Each year over 80 musicians travel from all over the United States and Canada to perform three classical concerts during Festival Week.

Whether a novice or seasoned classical music fan, a very special treat awaits hearing our orchestra live! Their exceptional performances bring audiences back year after year.

There will be time between events to enjoy the treasures of the spectacular Oregon coast: pristine beaches, succulent seafood, sand dunes, fishing and more!
