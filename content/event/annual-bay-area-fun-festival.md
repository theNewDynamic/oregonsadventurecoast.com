**A sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has forced the Coos Bay Downtown Association (CBDA) to make the difficult decision to cancel the 2021 Bay Area Fun Festival in downtown Coos Bay.** Out of concern for the health and well-being of the community, vendors, volunteers, and festival staff, the decision was made to move forward with canceling this yearâ€™s event.

**We look forward to welcoming this event back in 2022.**
