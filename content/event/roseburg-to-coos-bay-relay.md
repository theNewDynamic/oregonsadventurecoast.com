#### **IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR&nbsp; RACERS**

1\. We will no longer be handing out paper maps. **Please download the race packet to your smart phone BEFORE** starting the race or print on your computer at home. There is no cell service for most of the route, so make sure you download maps before you start. 2024 Maps will be updated as soon.

2\. &nbsp;Start times are based on the estimated 10k and 1 mile times you provided.&nbsp; Start times ensure that all teams finish roughly around the same time. Please come to the start line at least ½ hour before your start time to pick up your timing sheets and other race materials. There will be a brief meeting 15 minutes before start time. The coveted Race Director’s award will go to the team that finishes closest to their projected finish time. **We will post team start times a week before the race.**

3\. The race now ends at the Coos Bay History Museum.&nbsp; This means that the person running the last leg gets an extra mile we know you all (secretly) wanted.

4\. There will be a free dinner and free 7-Devil’s beer or non-alcoholic pro-biotic lemonade for all participants.&nbsp; Family and friends can purchase a meal at the event.&nbsp; Additional 7-Devils beer will be available for purchase.

5\.&nbsp; We will again have a spirit award! We have so much fun on this run/walk event that we want to have an award that promotes the fun and festive factor. Teams, bring your best party mode and be ready to vote for the most spirited team on course.

6\. &nbsp;Remember this course is not supported. You are responsible for ensuring your team makes it to the finish line safely. Bring lots of water and snacks. The roads are open to traffic and locals drive fast and furious.&nbsp; Please be aware at all times and wear bright colors.
