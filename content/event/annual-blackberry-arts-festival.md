#### The annual **Blackberry Arts Festival** celebrates the ART and the delicious blackberry!

The **Blackberry Arts Festival** is a **juried arts and craft festival** that has been happening for more than 40 years. The Festival highlights the works of local and regional artists and crafters in August, the typical timing of the annual harvest of the blackberry.

The **Blackberry Arts Festival** features an impressive array of metalwork, jewelry, quilts, candles, hand-painted clothing, wine, carved wood, and much more available for purchase. The festival also includes food vendors, some featuring delicious items made from Oregon blackberries, and features live music on the **Blackberry Jam** concert stage all weekend long!
