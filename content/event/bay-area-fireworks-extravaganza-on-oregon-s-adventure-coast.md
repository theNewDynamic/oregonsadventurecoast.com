## The Largest Fireworks Display on the Coast over Coos Bay on July 3, 2021

Don’t miss the Oregon Coast’s **largest fireworks display** on July 3rd. [The Mill Casino](https://www.kokwelresorts.com/coos-bay/), in conjunction with the [City of Coos Bay](http://coosbay.org/) and the [City of North Bend](https://www.northbendoregon.us/), will light up the skies over the Bay with this year's waterfront fireworks display.

**The fireworks display will be moved to the entrance of the Marshfield Channel, in Coos Bay (across from the Coos History Museum), where the fireworks can be seen from the Coos Bay Boardwalk, all along Front Street and Highway 101 to the North Bend Boardwalk. Anywhere that you can see the Bay, you will be able to see the fireworks, including from the top of Telegraph Hill and the Eastside boat ramp!**

This expanded viewing area will allow viewers to socially distance from others not in their group. We encourage residents and visitors alike to enjoy the fireworks while staying safe.
