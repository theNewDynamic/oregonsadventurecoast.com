**The Coos Bay-North Bend Rotary Club is proud to present the Annual Cruz the Coos and Show ‘n Shine as part of the Bay Area Fun Festival.** 

Cruz the Coos is one of the **longest-running and largest classic car cruises** on the Oregon Coast. It runs through the streets of downtown Coos Bay and is enjoyed by thousands of spectators. 

**The Show ‘n Shine** is an opportunity to see vintage cars and trucks that have been beautifully restored. Talk with the owners and visit restaurants and amenities offered at The Mill Casino Hotel and RV Park. 

**Proceeds generated from entry fees are put to use by the Rotary club to fund projects throughout the area including scholarships, humanitarian efforts, and other non-profit organizations in the community.** 

While you’re in the area, enjoy the **Bay Area Fun Festival**, one of the largest festivals on the Oregon Coast. The festival not only features the Cruz and Show ‘n Shine but the **Prefontaine Memorial 10K Run**, Street Vendors, a parade, and much more.
