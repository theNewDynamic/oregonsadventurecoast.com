## **Experience the Magic of Christmas in July at the Historic Egyptian Theatre!**

From July 19â€“21, escape the summer heat and step into a winter wonderland of holiday cheer at the Historic Egyptian Theatre in Coos Bay! **The Christmas in July Film Festival** brings beloved holiday classics back to the big screenâ€”including *Elf*, *Home Alone*, and *The Shop Around the Corner*â€”for a weekend of laughter, nostalgia, and heartwarming fun.

As the Egyptian Theatre approaches its 100th anniversary in 2025, thereâ€™s no better place to relive these timeless favorites than inside this beautifully preserved movie palace. With its golden-era charm and festive atmosphere, youâ€™ll feel like youâ€™ve been transported straight to the North Pole (without the snow!).

Bring your friends, family, or that one cousin who keeps their Christmas lights up year-roundâ€”and celebrate the season of joy a little early this year. Whether youâ€™ve watched these films a hundred times or are experiencing them for the first time, this holiday weekend at the Egyptian Theatre is sure to warm your heart.
