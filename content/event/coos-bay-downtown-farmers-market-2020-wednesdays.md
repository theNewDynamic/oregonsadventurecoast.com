### Coos Bay Downtown Farmer's Market Returns for its 20th Season!

On Wednesday, June 2nd through Wednesday, October 28th from 9:00 am until 2:00 pm, the Downtown Farmers Market returns to Coos Bay for its 20th Season.  Located on Central Avenue between Highway 101 and 4th Street, this year's market will look a bit different than previous years.

As an essential provider of food items, the market will start with only farmers and prepared food vendors. The craft and art vendors, non-profits, and educational booths will not be included this year.

Farmers Market Manager Melissa Hasart says, “The number one priority during the COVID-19 pandemic is everyone’s safety as we make farm fresh products to our community available in an open-air market.”

**The market will be set as an Essential Grocery-type Layout not a “Social Gathering” site.** It will feature traditional Homegrown and Local Essential products only. Vendors are encouraged to sell products in a bundle, prepackaged or individually. Some of the changes at the market include physical distancing and other practices.

* All Staff, Volunteers, and Vendors are required to wear **Fabric Face Coverings** and gloves, and vendors will have hand sanitizer at their booths.
* There will be **Hand Washing Stations** throughout the Farmers Market provided by Banner Bank
* **Safety Greeters** will be located throughout the market to encourage physical distancing.
* Vendors booths will be spaced at least 8 feet apart.
* Signs will be posted to **_“Shop with your Eyes”_**.
* There will be no customer contact with products prior to purchase.
* **Food vendors will provide “Take Out” only** and prepared food must be consumed off market premises.
* **The Market is open to senior citizens and vulnerable customers only from 9am-10am**

**Shoppers are encouraged to be safe, shop quickly and purchase only essential items.** They are also asked to wear Fabric Face Coverings and thoroughly wash hands before coming to  the market. Other things to consider include the following:

* **Bring personal hand sanitizer**
* **Send one healthy member of your household with a shopping list**
* **Leave pets and younger children at home (Service Animals are allowed)**
* **Remember to clean & wash all purchased produce at home before eating**

With the goal of “farm fresh to every fork,” the CBDA Farmers Market accepts SNAP-EBT. Tokens and $10 Double Up Bucks and can be received at the Farmers Market Information Booth located on Central Avenue next door to Jennie’s Shoes in Mall Block #2. Several Vendors also accept WIC and Senior Farm Direct Nutrition vouchers.
