### 2021 JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION 

The Coos History Museum and Alonzo Tucker Task Force Committee comprised of many local organizations and individual partnerships are hosting the first ever **Juneteenth Celebration**. Join us for a Special Edition Tuesday Talk, the installation of the Equal Justice Initiative Historical Marker for Alonzo Tucker, and a Free Day at the Coos History Museum with many opportunities to get involved and celebrate.

**Juneteenth**, also known as Jubilee Day or Freedom Day, is the oldest national celebration marking the ending of slavery in the United States. Juneteenth has been commemorated since June 19, 1865 when the last slaves in Galveston, Texas finally learned they were free- over two years after the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863. Today the event is widely celebrated across the United States.
