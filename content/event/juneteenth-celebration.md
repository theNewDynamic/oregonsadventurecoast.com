### 2022 JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION

**Juneteenth**, also known as Jubilee Day or Freedom Day, is the oldest national celebration marking the ending of slavery in the United States. Juneteenth has been commemorated since June 19, 1865 when the last slaves in Galveston, Texas finally learned they were free- over two years after the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863. Today the event is widely celebrated across the United States.

The Coos History Museum is hosting the **Annual** **Juneteenth Celebration** the weekend of June 18th and 19th with a wide variety of activities.

The Celebration actually begins with a **Special Edition Tuesday Talk** on Tuesday, June 14th. The weekend following the Tuesday Talk will be filled with music, dance, celebration and more.
