### 2023 JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION

**Juneteenth**, also known as Jubilee Day or Freedom Day, is the oldest national celebration marking the ending of slavery in the United States. Juneteenth has been commemorated since June 19, 1865 when the last slaves in Galveston, Texas finally learned they were free - over two years after the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863. Today the event is widely celebrated across the United States.

**The South Coast Equity Coalition,** in partnership with the Juneteenth Celebration Committee, is hosting Coos County’s **Third Annual Juneteenth Celebration** June 17th and 19th, 2023.

This year's theme is Family Reunion. They chose this theme because for Black communities family reunions have centered around resilience through storytelling, visibility, joy and food.

The Celebration begins with a **Keynote Address from Taylor Stewart of the Oregon Rememberance Project** and includes a **Family Reunion Reception** and a showing of Disney Pixar's **"Soul"** at the Egyptian Theatre.&nbsp;
