#### **THE RACE IS ON!! Saturday, September 20, 2025 - See below for some NEW elements this year!**

A rolling and challenging course, this 10K road race honors one of America’s greatest distance runners, Steve Prefontaine. Event includes the 10K run and a 2M walk. Hilly, out and back.

**From Linda Prefontaine:<br>"This year’s PREFONTAINE MEMORIAL RUN will be different. 2025 will mark 50 years of Steve's passing. This year's run will not be a celebration of his death, it will be a run commemorating his life, spirit and his legacy. That can only be done where it all started, in Coos Bay, Oregon. Come to Coos Bay on September 20th to run or walk in THE SPIRIT OF PRE."**

#### Things to Know:

**FUN WALK:** A fun walk will be held in conjunction with the 10K run. Walkers have their choice of walking the entire 10K route or the shorter 2-mile course. Walkers will start at the rear of the starting pack and follow the same course until reaching the corner of 10th & Central, where the 2-mile walkers take a left turn on 10th toward the stadium (see course map.) Chip timing will be provided for the 2-mile fun walk. Race timing devices will be turned off at 11:45 A.M. so we can produce timely and accurate race results. Full course walkers finishing prior to 11:45 A.M. will receive official times.

#### Other Things To See While Attending the Run:

* A commemorative monument was placed adjacent to the Coos Bay Visitor Information Center, displaying a bronze likeness of Pre and a list of all his American records held at the time of his death in May 1975.
* The Coos Art Museum, Prefontaine Gallery holds the permanent collection of Steve’s awards and memorabilia, as well as numerous photographs highlighting his illustrious running career. The Gallery also features a bronze sculpture of Pre that was gifted to the Prefontaine Foundation by Bonnye Keller Hall, former wife of the late Eugene, OR mayor Gus Keller. The sculpture was commissioned by the City of Eugene as a gift to outgoing mayor Gus Keller in recognition of his eight years of service as mayor.
* The Pre Mural in downtown Coos Bay across from Restaurant O, depicts three significant stages of Pre’s illustrious running career: as a national record-setting Marshfield High School runner, his ascent as a collegiate athlete at the University of Oregon, and his post-collegiate years highlighted by his scintillating performance in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany.
