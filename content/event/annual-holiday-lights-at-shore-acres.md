### **The brightest and most beautiful place on the Oregon Coast Shines**

Holiday Lights are set to sparkle again on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast** this season at Shore Acres State Park. Perched on the rugged cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Shore Acres State Park is famous for its beautiful 7-acre botanical gardens and Japanese lily pond. Visitors get a chance to stroll through this holiday tradition **every night from 4:30pm to 9:00pm, Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve** – including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. It has become a real holiday tradition for the whole family. **Admission is always free! However, parking at Shore Acres any time of the year is $10.**

Since its inception in 1987, the annual Holiday Lights celebration has seen a remarkable transformation. What started with just 6,000 miniature lights and a single Christmas tree has evolved into a dazzling spectacle featuring more than 325,000 LED holiday lights, 26 splendid Christmas trees, an array of illuminated sculptures, including some captivating animated ones, and enchanting landscape lights adorning the majestic trees that encircle the garden. This cherished community tradition is made possible by the <a href="https://shoreacres.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friends of Shore Acres</a>, the dedicated efforts of more than 1,500 volunteers, the invaluable support of local businesses, state park personnel, and the wholehearted backing of the community. Each season, it draws in thousands of visitors from all over the world!
