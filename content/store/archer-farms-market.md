property_description: |-
  Originally settled in the late 1880's, the Palouse Creek Ranch has been brought to life once more by Angie and Patrick Archer. The impressive traditional red barn and natural settings on over 20 private acres makes the perfect backdrop for intimate weddings, elopements, receptions, graduation parties, quincea√±era, community events, and more.
  Join us at our farm to table market, open daily, and look forward to our exclusive dining event: Trinity ; a limited guest farm to table specialty restaurant; offering seasonal Pacific Northwest Cuisine, highlighting locally foraged ingredients. We believe in sustainability. We want to show our guests we strive to be good stewards of the land and give back to our community through sustainable sourcing and donations to local nonprofits that serve families, women, and veterans.
