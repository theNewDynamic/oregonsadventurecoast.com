title: The Apothecary by Archer Farms
property_description: |-
  The Apothecary is a brick-and-mortar home goods and grocery located in North Bend on the beautiful Oregon Coast. Veteran-owned and operated, specializing in local, artesian, crafted products with a mixture of quality decor. Archer Farms originally settled in the late 1880s, the Palouse Creek Ranch has been brought to life once more by Angie and Patrick Archer. The impressive traditional red barn and natural settings on over 20 private acres make the perfect backdrop for intimate weddings, elopements, receptions, graduation parties, quincea√±era, community events, and more.
  We want to show our guests we strive to be good stewards of the land and give back to our community through sustainable sourcing and donations to local nonprofits that serve families, women, and veterans.
