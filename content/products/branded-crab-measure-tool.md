    Our branded plastic crab measure gauge is an essential part of any fishing equipment to check the scale of your catch before taking it with you.
    The gauge will help measure the size of crab caught during expeditions in a matter of seconds. It handles measurement of a crab measurement of 2 ¾”.
    Made of a heavy-duty plastic material, the gauge will last while out on the boat and in extreme conditions. A lanyard hole is on the end to conveniently link it to yourself or other gear for an easy reach. NOTE - I JUST PASTED THIS FROM ANOTHER - WE WILL NEED THE ACTUAL INFORMATION
