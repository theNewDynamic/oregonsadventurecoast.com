Visitors to Oregon’s Adventure Coast come for many reasons.  Getting a change to experience the coastal life if one of the main reasons.  And what could be more representative than the marriage of land and sea?  Both romantic and mysterious, lighthouses have been the backdrop of songs, stories and dreams.  For millennia, these guideposts have helped sailors navigate rugged coastal terrain.
