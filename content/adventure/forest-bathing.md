Forest bathing, also known as Shinrin-yoku, is the practice of immersing oneself in nature to improve physical and mental health. It involves spending time in forests, parks, or other natural environments and using all five senses to connect with nature. The idea is to slow down, relax, and be mindful of the present moment.

Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston, on the Southern Oregon coast, offers a variety of natural landscapes for forest bathing, including dunes, wetlands, and forests. The surrounding areas are rich in flora and fauna, providing ample opportunities to connect with nature and practice forest bathing.

Some popular places for forest bathing in the Coos Bay area include the coastal forest trail along the cliffs between Sunset Bay State Park and Cape Arago State Park, the cliffside at Shore Acres State Park, Yokam Point Horsfall Beach adjacent to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, Golden & Silver Falls State Natural area, Mingus Park and Simpson Park.

Walking mindfully in these natural areas can help reduce stress, improve mood, and boost the immune system. Research has shown that spending time in nature can lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, and increase levels of serotonin, a hormone associated with happiness and well-being.

In the Coos Bay area, you can engage in various activities that enhance your forest bathing experience, including hiking, yoga, and birdwatching. You can also simply spend time sitting or lying down in a quiet spot, taking in the sounds and smells of the forest. It is recommended to turn off your phone and leave other distractions behind to fully immerse yourself in the experience.

Additionally, the scenic beauty of Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston offers a chance to practice mindfulness and appreciate the present moment. Observing the changing colors of the leaves, the rhythmic sounds of the ocean, the patterns of sunlight filtering through the trees, and the sounds of birds and other wildlife can bring a sense of peace and calm.

Whether you prefer hiking, yoga, or simply sitting in a quiet spot, there is something for everyone in the natural beauty of Coos Bay.
