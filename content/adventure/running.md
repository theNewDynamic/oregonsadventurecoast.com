What makes Oregon’s Adventure Coast a runner’s paradise? For starters, there’s some storied running history here. Coos Bay is the birthplace of [Steve Prefontaine](/steve-prefontaine-story), possibly one of the best distance runners ever. It was here that Pre gained his love for running, where he honed his skills and where he trained to race himself to the top of the pack.&nbsp;

Oregon’s Adventure Coast is also home to unparalleled terrain for running – think ocean views, forested mountains, charming neighborhoods and parks galore. Looking for a scenic easy loop with Pacific Ocean vistas? We’ve got that. A longer, more challenging run to get you up to speed for the annual 10K Prefontaine Memorial Run? No problem. How about a weekly run with a group of friendly folks who love to get out and active with like-minded runners. With the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://southcoastrunningclub.org/">South Coast Running Club</a>, we’ve got that too.&nbsp;

### A run for everyone

Oregon’s Adventure Coast is a fantastic place to get your running miles in. You can hit the pavement in downtown Coos Bay, tread the trails from Sunset Bay to Cape Arago, jog lightly around the peaceful shores of Lower Empire Lake or jump into any number of annual organized runs. Some favorite routes, runs and groups include:

#### Sunset Bay

**Distance:** 3.8 miles<br>**Elevation gain:** 262 feet<br>**Summary:** It’s hard to imagine a more scenic run than, this nearly 4-miler, which cruises through some of the crown jewels of Oregon’s Adventure Coast, including Sunset Bay State Park and Shore Acres State Park.&nbsp;

#### South Coast Running Club
