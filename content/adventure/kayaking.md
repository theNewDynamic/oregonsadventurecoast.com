## Kayaking & Paddleboarding

Getting out on the water in a self-propelled vessel is to truly connect to the surroundings. With a number of lakes, rivers, ocean bays, and estuaries, Oregon's south coast offers kayakers and paddleboarders of all skill levels with an abundance of options. For example, take a guided tour of the [**South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve**](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx), a protected area of land and estuary. Guided tours are offered by the Slough staff and [**local tour guides**](/tour-guides-and-charters). There are a variety of birds that utilize this beautiful area including Bald Eagles, Osprey, Great Blue Herons, Egrets and Belted Kingfishers. The tides are great in this estuary so we will plan to ride the ebbing and flowing tides to make this paddle a little easier.

Paddle down the **Coquille River** or **Coos River**, in <a href="https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Sunset Bay</strong></a>, at <a href="https://www.coosbayor.gov/community/city-parks/john-topits-park-empire-lakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Empire Lakes</strong></a>, or in **Coos Bay**. For an extra adventure, bring your fishing gear and try your hand at [kayak fishing](/tripideas/kayak-fishing-on-the-south-coast)! An ADA accessible kayak launch is available at Empire Lakes (take the Hull entrance).

## Surfing on Oregon's Adventure Coast

We'd love to be able to say, "come on in, the water's fine" but it would be more like "come on in, the water's fine, but cold, so wear a wetsuit"! Join your fellow surfers at one of the finest, most exhilarating surfing spots along the South Coast, [Bastendorf Beach](http://www.co.coos.or.us/Departments/CoosCountyParks/Bastendorff.aspx) in Charleston. Bastendorff Beach is a favorite among surfers, kiters, beachcombers - locals and tourists alike. You’ll find an uncrowded beach and spectacular ocean views.

## Water Skiing

Tenmile Lakes in Lakeside, just 15 miles north of Coos Bay, is a great place for waterskiing and fresh water recreation! No wetsuit required from June to mid-September. The best time for flat water is before 11am or in the evening, but you can find a private spot to play down one of the many wind-protected arms of the lakes any time of the day. Try wakeboarding, tubing, waterskiing, trick skiing, knee boarding, wake surfing, or any watersport you can do behind a boat!

Tenmile Lakes is made up of two lakes (North and South) connected by a channel. You can launch your boat at the County Park on South Lake (parking fee required), beach your boat at the public sandy beach - Wulfy Beach - and play with the kids or soak up some sun (no fee required). Gas up your boat at and pick up boating supplies and snacks at Ringo’s Lakeside Marina on South Lake. Dock your boat at Osprey Point Pub & Pizza or the Lakeshore Lodge and enjoy a meal with a lake-front view.
