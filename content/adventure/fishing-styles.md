On Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston, the styles of fishing available are almost as varied as the fish and sea creatures themselves. Whether you’re looking for deep sea fishing on a charter, surfperch fishing from one of our amazing beaches or casting from a kayak on a scenic lake, we’ve got just about every style of fishing available. (All styles of fishing require a license. Find out what you need at our [fishing license page.)](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing-license-requirements/)

**Surf –** Surf fishing is exactly what it sounds like – you’re casting a line into the surf and hoping for a bite. The most popular fish are surfperch, slim swimmers that usually hang out about 30 feet offshore. You can fish for them year-round, but spring and early summer about an hour or two before high tide is best. Surfperch fishing takes a sturdier setup, including a 9- to 11-foot rod that can handle a 2- to 6-ounce weight. Many local bait and tackle shops rent this gear. All kinds of bait works, but anglers have lots of luck with mole crabs, marine worms, sand shrimp and mussels. [Horsfall Beach](mailto:https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/), just outside North Bend, offers great spots for surfperch fishing, as does Bastendorff Beach in Charleston.

**Jetty –** For an adventurous style of fishing, jetty fishing on Oregon’s Adventure Coast is hard to beat. The south and north jetties – accessed from Bastendorff Beach and the North Spit, respectively – jut out into the ocean near Charleston, giving anglers [a prime location](mailto:https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/eight-things-you-need-to-know-to-plan-your-oregon-coast-fishing-adventure/) for casting lines for rockfish, surfperch and other marine fish. A standard rod and reel and your bait of choice is really all you need for this kind of ocean fishing. Simply amble out onto the jetty – carefully and not during high surf advisories – find a good spot and start fishing.
