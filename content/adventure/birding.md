## EXCELLENT BIRDING OPPORTUNITIES

Rugged and largely undeveloped, Oregon’s south coast lures birders to view wildlife seldom encountered. The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge is protected habitat for 1.2 million nesting seabirds.



The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve near Charleston, with its 5,000 acres of saltwater marshes and mixed conifer forest, attracts Band-tailed Pigeons and Wrentits.

BOnjour

In April and August, Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge attracts rare shorebirds and is a feeding and resting stopover for migrating Pacific Golden-Plover, Dunlin, and Whimbrel.

Visit Oregon’s Adventure *Coast* in September for the annual [Oregon Shorebird Festival](https://www.oregonshorebirdfestival.org/). You’ll find field trips, talks, and a forum for all skill levels to share and exchange stories. Founded by the Cape Arago Audubon Society, and sponsored by several groups, you can expand your knowledge, and spend a long summer weekend on the Coast - what could be better?
