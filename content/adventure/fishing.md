Fishing opportunities are in no short supply here on Oregon's Adventure Coast! There are fish for every season and an endless choice of prime fishing spots to select from.

There are more than [30 lakes and rivers](/tripideas/fresh-water-fishing-options-by-body-of-water) to choose from in Coos County, and [bay and ocean fishing](/tripideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay). Come by boat, by foot, by kayak or by charter, the fish are biting.

We’ve put together a [list of resources](/img/rackcard-fishing-03-18.pdf) that will be helpful in planning your trip. Be sure to visit one of our [bait shops](/equipment-rent-and-buy) while in the area, they’re always willing to share pointers with visiting anglers.
