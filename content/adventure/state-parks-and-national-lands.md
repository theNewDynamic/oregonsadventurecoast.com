## State Parks and National Lands

On the Oregon Coast, many of the beaches are state parks and our area is no exception. Along the 8 mile [Cape Arago Loop](/img/cape-arago-loop-itinerary-2018.pdf) in Charleston you’ll find a trifecta of State Parks including Oregon Coast’s crown jewel, {{< link url="https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=68" >}}Shore Acres State Park{{< /link >}}, {{< link url="https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=70" >}}Sunset Bay State Park{{< /link >}} and {{< link url="https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=66" >}}Cape Arago State Park{{< /link >}}. The {{< link url="https://www.stateparks.com/oregon_dunes.html" >}}Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area{{< /link >}} is the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America and it is like no place on earth. The majestic dunes are one of our favorite attractions on the Southern Oregon Coast because they give visitors plenty of opportunities to find relaxation and adventure. If you head inland, you’ll find {{< link url="https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=67" >}}Golden and Silver Falls State Park{{< /link >}}, a hidden gem in the dense coastal forests. Hidden trails wind through all our state parks providing opportunities for hiking, sightseeing, photography and wildlife viewing.

## Shore Acres State Park – Winter Stormwatching!

Shore Acres State Park is often lauded as the best stormwatching spot on the entire Oregon Coast. Perched on top of an 80 foot cliff, this location allows for a safe distance above the waves while enjoying fantastic views. The term stormwatching has more to do with the ocean conditions rather than the actual weather conditions. When conditions in the ocean create large swells, they translate into amazing wave action. A 15 – 20 foot swell will turn into a wave over 100 feet high, and swells of 25-35 feet create waves as high as 250-300 feet high!
