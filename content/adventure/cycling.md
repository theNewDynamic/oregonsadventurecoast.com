## Make Some Tracks!

Whether you take to the road, fat bike on the beach, or careen around single-track trails, you will find heart pumping options on Oregon's Adventure Coast. Our friends at the Front Street Community Bike Works have put together a wonderful resource of cycling trail maps from no hills to dare devil!

## The Oregon Coast Bike Route

[Check out The Oregon Coast Bike Route (PDF).](https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Programs/TDD%20Documents/oregon-coast-bike-route-map.pdf) Oregon has been supporting bicycling since 1971 by developing bikeways throughout the state. Thousands of bicyclists enjoy the natural beauty of the Oregon Coast Bike Route annually. For the most part, it follows US Highway 101 as a shoulder bikeway. In several areas, the route departs from the main highway and follows county roads and city streets. These sections are closer to the ocean, are more scenic, and have lower traffic volumes and slower traffic speeds. Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston is one of the areas where cyclists depart from the main highway and takes a scenic detour along the rugged coastline on Cape Arago Loop and 7 Devils Road. [Click here for the North Bend to Bandon Oregon Coast Trail Map.](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PARKS/docs/OCT_g.pdf)

## Whiskey Run Mountain Biking Trail

[Check out the Whiskey Run Mountain Biking Trails here.](https://www.mtbproject.com/directory/8019222/whiskey-run-trails) The Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trails is a brand new, one-of-a-kind trail system on the Southern Oregon Coast. Ribbons of clay dirt flow and wind through the Coos County Forest in these cross-country style trails. Moderate climbing and fun descending make this system worth the drive to the gorgeous Southern Oregon Coast. The trail system is located about 10 minutes from Bandon or Coos Bay off Highway 101, in the mists of the coastal forest.

Located in an active logging forest, Whiskey Run gives visitors a view of the Coos County Forest most do not get to see - harvesting in this coastal forest while enjoying sweeping views, tranquil streams, and fern covered forest floors. The trails are a blend between flow and cross country style, and are great for all levels of riders with open sight lines, easy climbs, and chances to catch some air if you want. You'll dip and wind through the forest in this unique South Coast environment.

These professionally built trails are made to withstand the coast's weather, so when the weather is unfavorable in the Cascades and you want to ride some loam and clay, come on down to the coast. However, please don't ride if the trails are muddy. Check trail reports or call the local shops or guide services. _Note: 10 of the 30 miles are complete with Phase II construction set to begin soon._

## Other Mountain Biking Trails

[**BLUE RIDGE LOOP**](https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7028954/blue-ridge-loop) - is a multi-use trail system that gets some motorcycle traffic. It is a scenic area to ride, though despite it's elevation, views of lower areas are limited to non-existent. Given the different roads throughout the area, there are multiple ride options.

[**WINCHESTER NORTH**](https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7032115/winchester-north) - are used primarily by mountain bikers and motorcycles. The trails challenge even the best of riders. There are lots of ruts, roots, steep terrain, and other obstacles on the 17 miles of winding single track.

[**EMPIRE LAKES**](http://coosbay.org/uploads/PDF/Operations/Parks/John_Topits_Park/JOHN_TOPITS_PARK_TRAIL_MAP.pdf) - provides a more leisurely trail for biking but it is no less scenic. The trail system, 4 miles paved and 1.5 miles dirt track, is in John Topits Park, centered on the natural beauty of two lakes and stabilized dunes within the park.

[**EUPHORIA RIDGE TRAILS**](http://coostrails.com/traildescriptions/euphoriaridge/euphoriaridge.htm) - this 10 mile track begins on dirt road and quickly moves to single-track trails, through meadows, forest land, and tribal lands.

## Fat Biking

_From rocky headlands to wide-open shores, agates, seabirds, tide pools and lighthouses in the distance, the Oregon Coast is a balm for the soul. Why ride it? Because its 363 miles of glorious coastline are full of wonder, largely car-free and accessible for us all._  - Jen Anderson, Travel Oregon

Grab your big, balloon tires and bring your bike down to the beaches and the dunes. Ride along the miles of Horsfall Beach and into The Dunes for a challenging experience. As Katy Bryce put it in her article, [_Fat Biking 100 Miles of Oregon Coast_](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/fat-biking/fat-biking-100-miles-of-oregon-coast), "Riding fat bikes is not just beach cruising! [The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://www.stateparks.com/oregon_dunes.html) provided us with the opportunity to shred hard in soft sand. Hike up. Slide down. Giggle. Repeat."

Wherever you go fat biking on Oregon's Adventure Coast, [check the tides](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PARKS/pages/beach_tips.aspx#Know_the_tides) and try to go during low tide as much as possible. Beware of [sneaker waves](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PARKS/Pages/beach_safety.aspx) and stay off rocks and small, enclosed beaches. Respect the sensitive micro-environments, whether it’s birds or anenome you encounter.
