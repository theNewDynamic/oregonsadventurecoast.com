**What is forest bathing?**

Forest bathing is the practice of taking in the forest – or any natural, outside environment – through all of the senses. But it’s more than just soaking up the outside world; it’s also about being mindful and interacting with your natural surroundings – the sites, sounds, smells, and textures – to absorb the scientifically proven benefits of spending quiet time in nature.

The concept of forest bathing originated in the 1980s in Japan, where it’s known as *shinrin-yoku.* According to [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-forest-therapy-enhance-health-and-well-being-2020052919948), tech and industrial workers in Japan at the time were showing an increase in stress-related illnesses, which triggered leaders to create nature trails to entice people outside. Benefits ensued, including reduced stress, improved attention spans, boosted immune systems, and overall better moods.

**Why forest bathe?**

Less stress. A sense of wonder. Experiencing natural beauty. Lowered blood pressure and a stronger immune system.

All of these benefits – and more – have been linked to forest bathing. Many of the positives may be anecdotal or subjective, but in recent years, scientific studies have shown that forest bathing actually makes measurable positive impacts. For example, higher stress means higher levels of cortisol, a hormone that can play a role in high blood pressure, heart disease, headaches, and other illnesses. Tests have shown that a calm walk in the woods reduces cortisol levels.

Another study in Japan showed that people who spent two nights and three days in a forest had an increase in the number and activity of certain immune cells that fight viruses and even cancer. People who spent the same amount of time in an urban setting didn’t enjoy the same kinds of benefits.

Additionally, according to the [National Library of Medicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2793341/#:~:text=A%20forest%20bathing%20trip%20involves,limonene%20%5B1%E2%80%934%5D.), [trees emit natural oils]()[\[1\]](#_msocom_1) called phytoncides that have been proven to enhance the immune system, lower blood pressure, ward off depression and help cut anxiety.

**Who can do it?**

The simple answer: anyone. Young, old, fast, slow, stressed, or carefree, forest bathing is something that everyone can do. It’s not supposed to be strenuous. It is meant to help people slow down, relax, be mindful, and re-center themselves. Forest bathing also imparts the real benefits of time spent outside, which are physically and mentally good for anyone.

Those who are more adventurous may find themselves hiking deep into one of the towering forests on Oregon’s Adventure Coast or making their way across the storied sand dunes. But forest bathing works just as well for those who want to walk just a few steps to a quiet greenspace, a peaceful park or a Pacific Ocean overlook, which are abundant on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

**How to forest bathe**

One of the nicest things about forest bathing is that it’s easy to do. Remember, it’s all about being outside, in nature, quietly, slowing everything down and engaging all of your senses and being mindful, in the moment.

* Find a nice, natural place to go. (See a list of suggestions on Oregon’s Adventure Coast below.) This can be a nature park, a wilderness area, a beach, a garden, a lake, a river, or even your own backyard.
* Leave your devices behind. There’s nothing more distracting than a smartphone. Forest bathing is all about getting away from constant noise and interruptions so that you can clear and focus your mind.
* If you’re heading out on a trail, bring a small backpack with water, snacks, and other essentials like sunscreen.
* When walking, go slowly. Take note of your surroundings and engage your senses: smell and taste the fresh air, look at the trees and plants, listen and look for wildlife.
* If you find a comfortable place to sit, do so. Relax. Lay down. Close your eyes. Feel the ground beneath you, touch the forest floor, the trees, or the sand of the beach. Listen to the purling creek nearby; maybe even kick off your shoes and dip your toes in. Focus on your immediate surroundings and block out any negative thoughts.
* While it’s best not to have distractions, writing in a journal about what you’re experiencing can enhance your forest bathing experience by connecting you more closely with your surroundings. A small sketch pad or art set can provide a similar connection.
* Breathe deeply. Not only will it help you slow down and focus on the moment, but if you’re in a forest full of trees, you’ll enjoy some physical benefits as well. Trees and plants emit antimicrobial compounds called phytoncides that, when inhaled, have been shown to strengthen the immune system. Forests have higher oxygen levels than urban areas, so breathing deeply helps bring in oxygen-rich air that’s good for the body and mind.

  If you enjoy activities like yoga or tai chi, consider doing them outside in nature while you’re forest bathing. The benefits of the movements and mindfulness will be multiplied.
