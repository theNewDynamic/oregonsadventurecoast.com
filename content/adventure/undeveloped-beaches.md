## BEAUTY AT LANDS END

Come on in, the water’s warm (well, not really). But that is part of the charm here. 

Oregon’s Adventure Coast features the most versatile  coastal destination on the Oregon Coast! We are definitely a water destination.  Make sure to take advantage of the numerous lakes and rivers offering a refreshing summer dip, casual stroll, or fishing and water adventures.

But, it is our pristine Pacific coastline that offers so many different options. Visitors seeking a unique and personal experience can take their pick of terrain, vistas and privacy to connect with nature. 

Here, on our undeveloped coast, you can just sit, reflect and watch the ever-changing tide. There are also many areas that feel almost custom made, for you and your special companion to get lost in a romantic evening watching the sun set over the horizon.  And if beach-combing, whale watching, surfing and clamming or other popular pastimes are on your "to do" list, you can do it here. 

With our bay and Coastal landscapes, you could spend your whole vacation doing something different every day and still have plenty to 
do the next time you visit. With so many beaches to choose from when you visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast, you can have most any beach experience you want. A few of our most popular beaches are Bastendorff, Sunset Bay State Park, Horsfall Beach and Shore Acres State Park. 

What makes a visit here an adventure is that you can find your own favorite, that is, if you can choose.
