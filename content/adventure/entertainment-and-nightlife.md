## Live Music at Local Pubs

The Coos Bay-North Bend region already hosts a fantastic selection of annual festivals highlighting a range of musical genres (i.e. Oregon Coast Music Festival, Music on the Bay, BBQ, Blues and Brews by the Bay and many more). So it follows that our local music scene continues to grow at bars, restaurants and other venues.

Our area features some fabulous entertainment venues like [The Liberty Theatre](http://thelibertytheatre.org) (home of Little Theatre by the Bay) and the beautifully restored historic [Egyptian Theatre](http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/) where visitors can frequently find great local music and entertainment options. [The Back Alley Pub & Grill](https://northbendlanes.com/Back-Alley-Pub-Grill) at [North Bend Lanes](https://northbendlanes.com/) on Virginia Avenue is another popular spot for casual dining, microbrews, a full bar and cosmic bowling!

But it’s inside our rustic beloved local pubs where one can find real  hidden musical gems! Our authentic, down-to-earth, Oregon Coast vibe promises an evening you won’t find anywhere else.

Here are some of the best local places that support up and coming bands and musicians. If you plan to visit any of these, it’s best to call ahead to confirm their schedule.
