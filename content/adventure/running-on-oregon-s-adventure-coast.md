Run away on Oregon’s Adventure Coast – the perfect place to lace up your shoes and hit the pavement, trail or sand.&nbsp;

What makes Oregon’s Adventure Coast a runner’s paradise? For starters, there’s some storied running history here. Coos Bay is the birthplace of [Steve Prefontaine](/steve-prefontaine-story), possibly one of the best distance runners ever. It was here that Pre gained his love for running, where he honed his skills and where he trained to race himself to the top of the pack.&nbsp;

Oregon’s Adventure Coast is also home to unparalleled terrain for running – think ocean views, forested mountains, charming neighborhoods and parks galore. Looking for a scenic easy loop with Pacific Ocean vistas? We’ve got that. A longer, more challenging run to get you up to speed for the annual 10K Prefontaine Memorial Run? No problem. How about a weekly run with a group of friendly folks who love to get out and active with like-minded runners. With the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://southcoastrunningclub.org/">South Coast Running Club</a>, we’ve got that too.&nbsp;
