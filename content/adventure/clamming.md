### Clamming on Oregon's Adventure Coast

{{< floatimage src="/img/crabbing-and-clamming.jpg" float="right" alt="Girl Clamming in " size="50" >}}

If you’ve been anywhere along the Oregon Coast, you’ve probably heard a lot about clamming; but you might be wondering why it’s so popular among natives and visitors. Clamming is appealing to many Oregonians and visitors because it is relatively easy and the reward is a tasty treat best served in chowder, steamed or fried. There are no special skills required, no expensive equipment, and beginners can usually pick it up quite easily.

The low tides commonly found from Empire to Charleston make our region one of the top destinations for clam digging. Local bait & tackle shops are usually the best resource for first (and second, third, fourth) time clammers and can usually advise on conditions, regulations, equipment, etc. Some businesses, like [Basin Tackle](http://www.basintackle.com) on Kingfisher Rd in Charleston, even offer classes on how to use a clam pump and clean the clams (they even share secret recipes)!

**Ready to give it a shot?**  Here are some more tips for first-time clammers:

**1. Get your shellfish license.**

<p class="bullet-para-indent">Clams can be harvested all year on our coast, but ODFW does require a license. <a href="https://myodfw.com/crabbing-clamming/licensing-info">Click here to get your license.</a>
</p>

**2. Wear waterproof boots (trust us).**

<p class="bullet-para-indent">Just take a look at the photos and you will see the necessity of waterproof boots. Otherwise, you may loose or ruin your shoes!</p>

**3. Dress in layers!**

<p class="bullet-para-indent">Doesn’t matter what season it is, it can get chilly out there! Dress in layers that can get dirty.</p>

**4. Go to a bait and tackle shop before you head out.**

<p class="bullet-para-indent">Some of the best advice you will receive will probably come from one of the fishing experts at one of our\[ local bait and tackle stores\](/equipment-rent-and-buy). They can tell you when the best time of day to dig would be based on the tides. They can also help you make sure you have the right equipment- a bucket, a shovel (can be rented or borrowed) and/or a tube a.k.a. a “clam gun”.</p>

**5. Keep track of how many clams you dig.**

<p class="bullet-para-indent">You are allowed 20 bay clams per day in the aggregate, however, only 12 of which may be Gaper or Empire clams; again this is something someone at a local bait and tackle shop can help you with. <a href="https://www.dfw.state.or.us/mrp/shellfish/regulations.asp">Click here for ODFW's Regulations Summary for Marine Shellfish.</a></p>

**6. Watch these tutorials and learn from the pros!**

**Lower Coos Bay - Map & Species**

The lower bay (areas from the ocean entrance to the airport) is “marine dominated”, meaning there is little freshwater influence, and offers some of Oregon’s most productive shellfishing opportunities.
