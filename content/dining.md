## Dining for Your Oregon Coast Vacation

If you want to get it to go, the **delis and grocery stores** throughout Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston will let you pick the ingredients for that picnic or camp out, or you can take them back to make a meal at your accommodations that feature kitchen amenities. Eat well, you’re going to need your energy.
