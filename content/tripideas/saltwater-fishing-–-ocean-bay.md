Variety is the name of the game when it comes to fishing on Oregon’s Adventure Coast! The fun and sport of fishing builds memories of a lifetime. While here, it is worth exploring the different types of fishing, from shore, charter boat, bridge, and even kayak. Here are a few tips for your next fishing excursion.

Most Pacific salmon fishing occurs April through November, and sport seasons are regulated for Coho and Chinook salmon by state and federal agencies. Check with the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife for the most up to date <a href="https://myodfw.com/recreation-report" target="_blank">recreation report</a> and also check with tackle and bait shops for local information about specific seasons, catch limits and conditions.

Halibut is a spring and early summer fishery, while Albacore Tuna tend to be offshore from mid-summer through early fall. Bottomfish are available year around – weather permitting – and a charter trip usually ends with an ice chest full of fish. Check the <a href="https://myodfw.com/fishing" target="_blank">ODF&W website</a> or the Charleston field office (541-888-5515) for bottomfish catch limits.

Oregon’s Adventure Coast also offers several unique fisheries; <a href="https://myodfw.com/articles/how-fish-surfperch" target="_blank">surf fishing</a> from [local beaches](/undeveloped-beaches) for striped bass and surf perch and in-bay fishing for White sturgeon. Popular locations for surf fishing include [Horsfall Beach, Bastendorff Beach and Cape Arago State Park](/undeveloped-beaches). The best information about these fishing opportunities is available from local tackle shops.

_**Please note, whenever surf fishing, consult tidal charts, weather conditions and beware that sneaker waves occur on the Oregon Coast. Never turn your back on the ocean.**_
