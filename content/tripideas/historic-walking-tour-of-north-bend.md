## BRIEF HISTORY OF NORTH BEND

Asa Simpson – sea captain, shipbuilder, lumberman – built a sawmill and shipyard in the mid-1850s at the north bend of the Coos Bay. Most famous of the 55 vessels built here (1858-1903) was the Western Shore, a 3-masted “Oregon clipper” that sailed between Portland and Liverpool in a record time of 101 days in 1876.

Louis Simpson, Asa’s 21-year-old son, took over management in 1899. He purchased the townsite of Yarrow, added it to his father’s lands, and incorporated the City of North Bend in 1903. His goal was to imitate San Francisco.

Isolated by difficult terrain, the citizens relied on the waterways to carry cargo and passengers to points on the bay or sloughs. Ocean-going ships navigated the treacherous Coos Bay bar to access other ports.

Nearly 10,000 citizens now live in “the city that believes in itself.” The future may differ from the past, but North Benders remain proud of their town and history.

Listed below are just a few of our many points of interest.

**McCULLOUGH BRIDGE** (1936) Last of five coast bridges to complete the Roosevelt Highway (US 101). It was a depression-era WPA project, costing more than  $2,000,000, employed hundreds, has a length of 5,888 feet, a center height of 150 feet. Originally Coos Bay Bridge, it was renamed in 1947 for its designer Conde B. McCullough.

**SIMPSON PARK** Part of land bought by Asa M. Simpson in 1855. Simpson heirs deeded about 50 acres of the land to the city in 1916. The property was divided by Highway 101's completion in 1936 and was considered to be the city park from earliest days of North Bend (1903). It was the site of an early ball field and used as an auto camp from the 1920s to the 1940s. The park features a variety of old conifers including sequoia. See also Ferry Road Park.
