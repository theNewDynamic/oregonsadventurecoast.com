Fishing in Oregon – and on Oregon’s Adventure Cost – doesn’t just have to be about casting lines and reeling ‘em in. In fact, some of the most popular fishing in these parts is more about shovels, pots and shellfish. We’re talking about clamming and crabbing.

Throughout the year, low tides provide access to a bountiful resource here: clams. [A clam-digging adventure](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/clamming/) on the tidelands of Coos Bay can result in a tasty treat whether served in chowder, steamed or fried. The most common varieties found around the bay include gaper, cockle, littleneck, softshell and butter. Check with the [Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife](https://myodfw.com/articles/oregon-shellfish-regulations) website for the most current shellfish regulations and harvest notices.

And no trip to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast** is complete without Dungeness crab, and the best crab are always the ones you bring up yourself from the waters of lower Coos Bay. Rent or buy a crab ring and try your luck; the payoff will be a fresh crab feast you’ll always remember. And you’ll keep coming back for more! Rental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores often rent and sell rings. Here’s a short list of some locations:
