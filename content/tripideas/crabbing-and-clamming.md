Throughout the year low tides provide access to a bountiful resource; clams. A clam-digging adventure on the tidelands of Coos Bay can result in a tasty treat whether served in chowder, steamed or fried. The most common varieties found around the bay include gaper, cockle, littleneck, softshell and butter. Check with the <a href="https://www.dfw.state.or.us/mrp/shellfish/regulations.asp" target="_blank">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife</a> website for the most current shellfish regulations and harvest notices.



And finally, no trip to the Adventure Coast is complete without Dungeness crab, and the best crab are always the ones you bring up yourself from the waters of lower Coos Bay. Rent or buy a crab ring and try your luck; the payoff will be a fresh crab feast you’ll always remember. And you’ll keep coming back for more. Rental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores often rent and sell rings. Here’s a short list of some locations:
