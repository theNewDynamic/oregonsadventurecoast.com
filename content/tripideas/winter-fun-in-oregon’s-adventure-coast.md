Winter steelhead fishing and clamming are popular winter activities on the Oregon Coast, but it doesn’t end there. Watch waves crashing at Shore Acres, visit museums or catch a show at a local theater, tackle the Oregon Dunes or roll the dice at The Mill Casino or Three Rivers Casino. Here are some ideas to start planning your wintercation in Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston\!

### Fishing and Crabbing

In the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area, there’s a fish for every season and a seemingly endless choice of prime [fishing](/fishing) spots. Steelhead, crabbing and clamming are the superstars in the winter months, while spring is all about salmon, surf perch, and bass. Come year-round by boat, by foot, by kayak, or by charters and guides.

### Storm Watching

Oregonians know it as storm watching, but it could really be called wave watching. The formation of the cliffs at <a target="_blank" href="https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=68">Shore Acres State Park</a> meet with the mighty Pacific Ocean to create 100-foot waves that are a photographer and ocean lover’s dream.

### Coast Culture

Take in a show at The Liberty Theatre, home of the <a target="_blank" href="http://thelibertytheatre.org">Little Theatre on the Bay</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com">Egyptian Theatre</a>, visit unique **museums** and experience the rich artistic culture and maritime history of the Oregon Coast.

### Ride On

There’s no place on earth like the [Oregon Dunes](/untamed-dunes). Wind-sculpted dunes tower up to 500 feet above sea level and stretch forty miles for non-stop fun. See for yourself why thousands come to our dunes for the thrill of the ride. Adrenaline junkies can rent their own quad, while nature lovers can take a guided tour.

### Hit a Strike or Strike it Rich

Small towns aren’t without big thrills: the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area is home to <a target="_blank" href="http://northbendlanes.com">North Bend Lanes</a>, where you can Cosmic Bowl on a stormy winter evening. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themillcasino.com">The Mill Casino &bull; Hotel &amp; RV Park</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.threeriverscasino.com/coos-bay-casino">Three Rivers Coos Bay</a> offer non-stop casino action just waiting for you.
