Winter steelhead fishing and clamming are popular winter activities on the Oregon Coast, but it doesn’t end there. Watch waves crashing at Shore Acres, visit museums or catch a show at a local theater, tackle the Oregon Dunes or roll the dice at The Mill Casino. Here are some ideas to start planning your wintercation in Oregon’s Adventure Coast:

### Fishing and Crabbing

In the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area, there’s a fish for every season and a seemingly endless choice of prime [fishing](/fishing) spots. Steelhead, crabbing and clamming are the superstars in the winter months, while spring is all about salmon, surf perch and bass. Come year-round by boat, by foot, by kayak or by charters and guides.

### Storm Watching

Oregonians know it as storm watching, but it could really be called wave watching. The formation of the cliffs at <a href="https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=68" target="_blank">Shore Acres State Park</a> meet with the mighty Pacific Ocean to create 100-foot waves that are a photographer and ocean lover’s dream.

### Coast Culture

Take in a show at The Liberty Theatre, home of the <a href="http://thelibertytheatre.org" target="_blank">Little Theatre on the Bay</a> or the <a href="http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com" target="_blank">Egyptian Theatre</a>, visit unique **museums** and experience the rich artistic culture and maritime history of the Oregon Coast.

### Ride On

There’s no place on earth like the [Oregon Dunes](/untamed-dunes). Wind-sculpted dunes tower up to 500 feet above sea level and stretch forty miles for non-stop fun. See for yourself why thousands come to our dunes for the thrill of the ride. Adrenaline junkies can rent their own quad, while nature lovers can take a guided tour.

### Hit a Strike or Strike it Rich

Small towns aren’t without big thrills: the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area is home to <a href="http://northbendlanes.com" target="_blank">North Bend Lanes</a>, where you can Cosmic Bowl on a stormy winter evening.  <a href="https://www.themillcasino.com" target="_blank">The Mill Casino • Hotel & RV Park</a> and <a href="https://www.threeriverscasino.com/coos-bay-casino" target="_blank">Three Rivers Coos Bay</a> offer non-stop casino action just waiting for you. With more than 750 slots, Vegas-style table games, restaurants and lounges, there’s something going on 24 hours a day at our two casinos.
