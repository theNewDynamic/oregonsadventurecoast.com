Lake, stream and river fishing are popular pursuits on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. Early summer and late fall salmon runs offer the best chances for a great river catch, and hearty sportsmen will enjoy the challenges of winter steelhead fishing. The Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife also [stocks many area lakes with trout](https://myodfw.com/fishing/species/trout/stocking-schedule), and most lakes and ponds around here also host warm-water species like largemouth bass, yellow perch, croppy, bluegill and catfish, all of which were introduced in the early 1900s.

For the most updated fishing information and scouting reports, contact the Charleston ODFW field office at 541.888.5515.
