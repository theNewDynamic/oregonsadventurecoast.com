North Bend Oregon may very well be the best kept secret on the Oregon Coast. Situated on the north bend of the Coos Bay (hence its namesake) this gem of a community is home to beautiful beaches, eclectic stores, antique shops, music, theatre, friendly locals, nightlife, restaurants, majestic sand dunes, the historic McCullough Memorial Bridge and much much more.

North Bend’s unique history and culture gives it an undeniable charm that has appealed to travelers for decades. The town is also home to the Oregon Coast’s only airport, the <a href="https://cooscountyairportdistrict.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southwest Oregon Regional Airport</a> (airport code: OTH), the largest enclosed shopping mall on the Oregon Coast, <a href="http://ponyvm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pony Village Mall</a> in addition to [Horsfall Beach](/undeveloped-beaches) and the North Spit, named as one of Sunset Magazine’s top ten beach strolls in the western region.

Here are a few ways to unwind and spend a lovely day (or two) in our treasured community of North Bend, Oregon.

### Morning

Begin by fueling up your day with a hearty breakfast at the <a href="http://www.pancakemill.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pancake Mill Restaurant and Pie Shoppe</a> on Tremont Street, HWY 101. Make sure you get there early, this spot is very popular with locals and visitors alike!

After feasting on an epic breakfast, head to the <a href="https://www.stateparks.com/oregon_dunes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon National Dunes Recreational Area</a> for your first adventure of the day! Most of the ATV/dune buggies rental places open around 10 a.m. so you should have time for a quick morning hike before taking on the thrill of riding across massive tracks of sand, through forests and onto the beach! Local businesses like [Spinreel Dune Buggy & ATV Rentals, Steve’s ATV Rental, and Dune Bugs](/equipment-rent-and-buy/) offer dune buggy & ATV rentals and instruction. Call ahead to confirm hours and availability. Be sure to dress in layers, the weather is always changing.

### Lunchtime

Call it a hunch, but you’ll probably work up an appetite during your adventure on the sand dunes. Fortunately, North Bend has no shortage of fantastic lunch spots. Captain’s Choice Family Fish House on Virginia Avenue is a great spot for seafood, fish ‘n chips and chowder. Yeong’s Place is very popular among locals for their fantastic burgers and friendly service. The Plank House Restaurant inside The Mill Casino serves up a fabulous crabcake sandwich and offers gorgeous views of the bay. Visit our [Dining](/dining) section to see more ideas.

### Early Afternoon

After a delicious lunch, be sure to hit Sherman & Virginia Avenues for an afternoon shopping and strolling in **North Bend’s “old town” district**. You’ll definitely want to hit **Painted Zebra Designs**, **Fat Cat Antiques** and **Beauty & the Beast Antiques**. Take a left on Virginia Ave and experience the <a href="https://www.100steps.info/north-bend-boardwalk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">North Bend Boardwalk</a> and visit and view our bay framed in forested hills. Take a right on Virginia and you will be headed for the largest covered mall on the Oregon coast, [Pony Village Mall](http://ponyvm.com). If there is anything you may need you can probably find it here. Major as well as small local businesses abound in this gathering place.

### Mid-Late Afternoon

Time to hit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Books-By-The-Bay-232314893488700/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Books by the Bay</a>, another favorite among locals. Browse for a good read from their selection of new and used books. If you need a “pick-me-up”, head to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BayBrewCoffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bay Brew</a> in The Mill Casino parking lot for drive-thru espresso, coffee, tea, smoothies & kid-friendly beverages.

If there is time, we also recommend grabbing your camera (if you already haven’t) and checking out the lovely views of the historic **McCullough Memorial Bridge** from Ferry Road Park or walk along the **North Spit Overlook** and check out the wildlife.

### Early Evening

For your evening itinerary, you can’t beat a neighborhood dining experience at a locally owned restaurant like **Ciccarelli’s** or **Hilltop House Restaurant and Lounge** overlooking the water. After dinner, hit <a href="https://www.themillcasino.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mill Casino • Hotel &amp; RV Park</a>and take your chances with lady luck on their massive selection of Vegas style slots and table games.

### Late Evening

**Warehouse 101**, located inside the Mill Casino, is a fun destination for live music, comedy, watching the game or just hanging out with a brew or two. If you’re in the mood for a something different, get your tickets in advance for one of the live musical, drama, comedy or variety show performances at LTOB/Little Theatre on the Bay at <a href="http://thelibertytheatre.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Liberty Theatre</a>. For those who want a&nbsp;laid back, local community vibe, <a href="http://northbendlanes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Back Alley Pub &amp; Grill at North Bend Lanes</a> on Virginia Avenue is another popular spot for casual dining, microbrews, a full bar and cosmic bowling!
