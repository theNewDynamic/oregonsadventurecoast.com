The towns of Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston, located on Highway 101 in the southern part of the state, are called “Oregon’s Adventure Coast” for a reason. Surrounded by thick forests and perched on an ocean bay, Coos Bay is the gateway to some of the coast’s best outdoor fun.

**Do the Dune** Just to the north in the town of North Bend, you’ll find the <a href="https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/destinations/parks-forests-wildlife-areas/oregon-dunes-national-recreation-area/" target="_blank">Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</a>. The enormous, wind-sculpted dunes, some as high as 500 feet, sprawl along a 40-mile stretch of coast. Explore the sandy terrain along hiking trails, or take to the sand on a dune buggy ride or rented ATV.

**Feeling Crabby?** Get a taste of Oregon’s official state crustacean — Dungeness crab —  the DIY way. Most [local fishing shops](/equipment-rent-and-buy/) supply the necessary licenses and equipment. Toss your pot in at the Charleston Boat Basin. 

**Surfs up!** Brave the Oregon waves on a surfboard. <a href="http://www.surfwaxers.com" target="_blank">Waxer’s Surf Shop</a> in Coos Bay offers lessons for all levels and provides everything you need — wetsuit, booties, gloves, hood, board and, most important, enthusiastic encouragement. Locals love <a href="https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bastendorff-beach/" target="_blank">Bastendorff Beach</a> outside of Charleston.

**Taste the Coast.** Try <a href="http://www.sharkbites.cafe" target="_blank">Shark Bites Café</a> for tasty tacos, burgers and seafood sandwiches. <a href="https://hilltophouserestaurant.com" target="_blank">Hilltop House Restaurant & Lounge</a> offers beautiful views of the Haynes Inlet and a menu rich in fresh fish. At <a href="https://www.themillcasino.com/dining-bars/" target="_blank">The Mill Casino • Hotel & RV Park</a>, choose from the Plank House, the Saw Blade Buffet, Warehouse 101 and others. <a href="http://www.thecoachhousecoosbayor.com" target="_blank">The Coach House Restaurant & Lounge</a> offers barbeque, seafood and steak.
