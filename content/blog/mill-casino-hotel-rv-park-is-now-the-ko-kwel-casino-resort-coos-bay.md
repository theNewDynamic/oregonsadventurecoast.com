Last month, the [Coquille Tribe](https://www.coquilletribe.org/) and the [Coquille Economic Development Corporation](https://www.tribal.one/) (CEDCO) [officially announced](https://www.coquilletribe.org/coquille-tribe-to-rename-casino-after-30-years-of-success/) a new chapter in the casino and hotel’s 30-year history: **The Mill Casino • Hotel & RV Park is now the** [Ko-Kwel Casino Resort \| Coos Bay](https://www.kokwelresorts.com/coos-bay/)**.**

Tribal leaders say the rebranding reflects the values, heritage, and ancestral lands of the Coquille people, whose ancestors once thrived across more than a million acres in Southwestern Oregon. The new name, **Ko-Kwel**, honors the traditional pronunciation of the Tribe’s name. Its roots go back generations, to a time when tribal members fished for lamprey, an eel-like fish they called *scoquel*. When white fur traders and settlers arrived on the southern Oregon coast, they began referring to the people in the region as “Coquille,” spelling it like the French word for “shell.” [Click here to learn more](https://www.coquilletribe.org/our-people/how-do-you-pronounce-that/) about the origins and proper pronunciation of the Coquille Indian Tribe’s name.

As Coos County’s second-largest employer, the Coquille Tribe is a key economic driver on the South Coast, supporting local businesses and investing in the region’s vitality. “It was time for the Coquille Indian Tribe’s long-standing gaming and hospitality brand to clearly represent tribal ownership and the core values that define our leadership and service standards, to be proudly recognized as “Coquille,” states Margaret Simpson, CEO of the Coquille Economic Development Corporation, which manages the tribe’s gaming and hospitality operations with its diverse economic portfolio.

“The tribe has faced significant challenges in its journey towards self-reliance over the past 35 years. As we expand our hospitality brand and outreach, we wanted to unify our projects under a single brand that honors our culture and recognizes the achievements of our tribal citizens.”

Since opening in May of 1995, The Mill Casino, once an old sawmill, has grown into one of top tourist destinations on the Southern Oregon Coast. And while the name and logo may be getting a fresh update, visitors can rest assured: the [exciting gaming](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/gaming/), dining, entertainment, and beloved annual events that draw nearly a million visitors each year aren’t going anywhere.

In fact, the newly renamed **Ko-Kwel Casino Resort** is undergoing a major expansion. Plans include Oregon’s first tribally owned distillery, which will produce vodka, gin, whiskey, and bourbon. The resort will also feature golf swing suites, new dining options, and retail spaces. And in a first for Oregon, Ko-Kwel Casino Resort now offers **in-person sports betting**, thanks to a new partnership with Caesars Sportsbook. The new name is already visible, with updated signage installed on the hotel tower.

And yes, all your favorite events are still on the calendar, including the [Annual July 3rd Fireworks over the Bay](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/july-3rd-4th-fireworks-over-the-bay/), [Annual Food Truck Off](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/the-mill-casino-food-truck-off/), [Annual Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/mill-luck-salmon-celebration/), and more.

“The Ko-Kwel Casino Resort in Coos Bay will continue the legacy of the Mill as the economic engine for the region, allowing the tribe’s commitment to expanding our hospitality offerings throughout the Pacific Northwest,” explains Coquille Tribal Chair Brenda Meade. “Coquille has held deep historical significance in this region from time immemorial; it’s time we introduce that significance to the rest of the world through our branding.”
