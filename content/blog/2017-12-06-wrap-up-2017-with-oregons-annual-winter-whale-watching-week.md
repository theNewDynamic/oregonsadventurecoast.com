<h2>Winter 2017 Whale Watch Week is December 27th – 31st</h2>

The end of another year is approaching which means it's time for the gray whales make their annual journey from the arctic waters of the Bering and Chukchi seas to the warmer waters near Baja Mexico. Whale watchers will often see gray whales from Oregon’s shore nearly year-round, but the last week of the year is special.



<strong>December 27th through December 31st</strong> is Oregon Parks and Recreation Department's <a href="http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=thingstodo.dsp_whaleWatching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winter Whale Watch Week</a>, one of the peak migration weeks of the year.



Researchers estimate that 18,000-plus gray whales now live in the eastern north Pacific area. About 30 whales per hour migrate past the Oregon coast during the peak southbound migration. By comparison, six per hour pass by on the northbound trip, but that return trip is spread over four months. Some 200-plus of these whales drop off the migration route and feed along the Oregon coast all summer.



Expert volunteers from the <a href="https://whalespoken.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whale Watching Spoken Here®</a> program will be stationed at 24 locations on the Oregon Coast each day during Winter Whale Watch Week from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. to help curious whale watchers to spot the migrating whales and learn more about them.



"The winter and spring Whale Watch Weeks along the Oregon coast are recognized as some of the best opportunities to view the annual gray whale migration anywhere in the world," it says on organization's website."Researchers estimate that 18,000-plus gray whales now live in the eastern north Pacific area. About 30 whales per hour migrate past the Oregon coast during the peak southbound migration."



Shore Acres State Park is one of designated <a href="https://whalespoken.wordpress.com/best-places/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whale watching sites</a> along the Oregon Coast.



Shore Acres State Park is located on the Cape Arago Highway, 13 miles southwest of Coos Bay/North Bend and U. S. Highway 101. Please visit <a href="http://shoreacres.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoreacres.net</a> for park information and regulations.
