  Last month, one of the most precious gems on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos
  Bay, North Bend, Charleston, celebrated its 50th anniversary. The South Slough
  National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR), the first of 30 in the United
  States, is an essential habitat with nearly 7,000 acres of forests, salt
  marshes, mudflats, and water channels, all of which are home to diverse
  ecosystems with hundreds of native plant and animal species.

*“For 50 years, the South Slough Reserve has demonstrated the power of partners coming together to protect and restore special places along our coast. The research, education and stewardship activities pioneered at South Slough will continue to serve as a model for the larger research reserve system — and provide tangible benefits to Oregon’s coastal ecosystems and communities – for decades to come.” - NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D*

Last month, one of the most precious gems on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, celebrated its 50th anniversary. [The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR)](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/ss/pages/default.aspx), the first of 30 in the United States, is an essential habitat with nearly 7,000 acres of forests, salt marshes, mudflats, and water channels, all of which are home to diverse ecosystems with hundreds of native plant and animal species. It is a collaborative effort between the Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with a mission to enhance stewardship and understanding of Pacific Northwest estuaries and coastal watersheds through education, research, and community involvement.

With National Estuaries Week happening later this month (September 21-28, 2024), we wanted to stop and reflect on the incredible impact SSNERR has had on our community, environment, and beyond.

### A Natural Treasure in Our Own Backyard

Most folks do not realize the positive impact estuaries like South Slough have on our daily lives and the health of our planet. Since its establishment in 1974, SSNERR has been at the forefront of estuarine research and conservation and has made significant strides in habitat restoration, species protection, and climate resilience. “The mission of the Reserve is to improve the stewardship and the understanding of Pacific Northwest estuaries and coastal watersheds,” says Deborah Rudd, the Public Involvement Coordinator for the Reserve, in the article [State of the Parks: South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve](https://theworldlink.com/news/local/state-of-the-parks-south-slough-national-estuarine-research-reserve/article_fbeee28c-0749-11ef-92a6-e3addc0a1de5.html). “All reserves are partnerships between NOAA and coastal states, and reserves have a three-pronged approach. We embrace that from an education vantage, from a stewardship vantage, and from a research vantage.”

Last month, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek was joined by Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade, and State Treasurer Tobias Read, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the [South Slough Reserve](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/ss/pages/about.aspx) with the opening of 12 new educational exhibits with engaging touchscreen displays in the Reserve’s Visitor Center. “The new exhibits are a direct result of the state’s collaboration with Oregon’s sovereign Tribal nations,” Governor Kotek said. “They advance a core part of the Reserve’s mission: to couple scientific breakthroughs and traditional ecological knowledge to inform communities. I am excited to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the South Slough Reserve alongside so many partners who have played a role in its success.”

Additionally, the reserve is embarking on a community-wide video story collection effort, inviting locals to share their personal experiences and memories of the reserve. These stories will help create a living history that reflects the reserve's impact on the community over the past five decades.

### National Estuaries Week: A Time to Reflect and Act

National Estuaries Week, held from September 21-28, 2024, is a time to raise awareness about the critical role that estuaries play in our environment and to encourage collective action to protect these vital ecosystems. Estuaries are more than just a place to hike and unwind; they are living, breathing resources dedicated to sustainability as well as understanding the effects of climate change, habitat loss, and other environmental issues threatening our coastal communities.

Whether you're a long-time supporter of the reserve or new to the area, National Estuaries Week is the perfect opportunity to get involved. We invite you to visit the [South Slough Reserve](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/ss/pages/about.aspx), explore its beauty on its many hiking and paddle trails, and take part in its ongoing journey of conservation and discovery. You can support estuary conservation by volunteering, participating in events, or simply spreading the word about the importance of protecting these natural treasures.
