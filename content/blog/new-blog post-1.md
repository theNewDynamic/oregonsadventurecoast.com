## TOP EXPERIENCES

Here are some recommended points of interest to help you get the full experience of the beautiful Oregon Dunes and build memories that last a lifetime:

### \#1 EXPLORE VIA OFF-ROAD VEHICLE

![](/img/Oregon%20Dunesblog-695x322-1.jpg)

One of the more popular ways to explore the Oregon Dunes is on a thrilling [ATV or OHV ride](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/atv-motorsports/). If you don’t own one, there are multiple businesses that offer rentals. All you need is a driver’s license and a sense of adventure!

**ATV Equipment Rentals and Tours**

Here are some local businesses that have been recommended for ATV/UTV, Sand Board & Sled Rentals, and tours.

* Dune Bug ATV Rentals- Behind Myrtlewood Factory at Hauser and Hwy 101, North Bend. [www.oregondunebugrentals.com/home.htm](https://oregondunebugrentals.com/home.htm)​
* Spinreel Dune Buggy & ATV Rentals, Inc- 67045 Spinreel Rd, North Bend. [www.ridetheoregondunes.com](https://www.ridetheoregondunes.com/)
* Steve’s ATV Rental - 68512 US-101, North Bend. [www.stevesatvrentals.com](https://stevesatvrentals.com/oregon-dunes)

North Bend offers the largest riding area on the Oregon Coast, stretching from Spinreel Campground to Horsfall Road, just north of Coos Bay. Here’s how to make the most of your ride:

* **Choose the right vehicle.** Rental options vary, so don’t hesitate to ask for recommendations or check reviews to find the best fit for your skill level and comfort.
* **Book a guided tour.**  First-timers consistently rave about Spinreel’s [Follow Me Tours](https://www.ridetheoregondunes.com/follow-me-tour/). You’ll drive a rented vehicle while following a seasoned guide on a curated route that highlights the best views and terrain. It’s a favorite splurge among TripAdvisor reviewers.
* **Ride to the beach.** If you're going unguided, head toward [Horsfall Beach](https://traveloregon.com/plan-your-trip/places-to-stay/campgrounds/horsfall-beach/) for wide-open sand, ocean views, and a nearly empty stretch of shoreline. Start from Box Car Hill to access the Horsfall Dunes—a spacious area perfect for riding with direct access to the beach.
* **Give yourself time.** Plan for at least two hours of ride time. That’s usually enough for beginners to explore the dunes, reach the beach, and take in stunning views of the ocean, lakes, and forests. Be sure to budget extra time for check-in and safety orientation—your ride officially starts once rental location staff clear you to go.
