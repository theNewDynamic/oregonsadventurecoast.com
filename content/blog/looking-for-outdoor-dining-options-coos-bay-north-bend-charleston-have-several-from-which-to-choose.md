We have compiled a list of those restaurants that are offering outdoor dining and will add to it as more restaurants open outdoor spaces.

**_We recommend calling the restaurant of your choice prior to visiting._** _Most are now taking reservations for their outdoor dining tables as space is limited and demand is high_.

If you prefer to grab some take-out and eat it while watching the sunset from Sunset Bay State Park or another wonderful vantage point along our rugged coastline, visit our [Dining Page](/dining/) for the full list of restaurants in the area!
