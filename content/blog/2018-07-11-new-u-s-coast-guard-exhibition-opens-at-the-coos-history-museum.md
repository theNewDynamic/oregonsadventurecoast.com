This marks the 37th anniversary of the Coast Guard Art Program – known as COGAP. The program utilizes fine art as an outreach tool for educating diverse audiences about the United State Coast Guard. Today, more than ever, the service addresses an abundance of challenges as it works to maintain the nation’s security at home and abroad and execute its 11 statutory missions such as drug interdiction, marine safety and maritime law enforcement. <a href="https://www.uscg.mil/Community/Art-Program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to learn more about COGAP</a>.

The Coos History Museum will waive admission to military veterans and their spouse/partner through December 31, 2018. The free admission program was created through generous financial support from the Coquille Tribal Community Fund and the Mr. and Mrs. Michael L. Keiser Foundation. During 2018, the Coos History Museum special exhibit focus is dedicated to honoring veterans. There will be 4 special exhibits this year, beginning with the Smithsonian’s Patriot Nations: Native Americans in Our Nation’s Armed Forces, Oregon Department of Veterans’ Affairs exhibit entitled I Am Not Invisible, United States Coast Guard Art, and the Coos History Museum’s Vet Ink: Military Inspired Tattoos.
