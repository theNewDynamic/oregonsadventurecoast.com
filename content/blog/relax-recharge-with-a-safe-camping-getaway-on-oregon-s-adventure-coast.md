Many of us are experiencing [pandemic fatigue](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/how-to-deal-with-coronavirus-burnout-and-pandemic-fatigue) that is only exacerbated by tense social, economic and political tensions.

Outdoor enthusiasts have long known that camping is an excellent way to retreat into nature and [relieve stress and anxiety](https://www.justraveling.com/alternative-travel/how-camping-can-relieve-stress-anxiety/).

In many areas, people can visit parks, trails, and open spaces as a way to relieve stress, get some fresh air, and stay active.”

“Experiencing the quiet, awe-inspiring beauty of nature can not only uplift your spirits, it can improve your health. Think of Oregon’s vast outdoors as your place to relax and recharge, especially right now when many of us are vulnerable to stress and anxiety. You can help us keep this place beautiful for generations to come by [recreating responsibly](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/take-care-out-there/) and avoid taking unnecessary risks.”- Travel Oregon

While these destinations can offer much-needed wellness benefits, it is important that you follow the steps below to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Please adhere to the following guidelines to protect the health and safety of yourself, and our community.

* Closures or changes to available facilities can happen without notice due to public safety concerns. Have a backup plan in case your destination closes unexpectedly.
* Find out the COVID-19 Impact on Oregon State Parks. Some parks are open for day-use and camping, with reduced services. Check the [Park Status Map](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=visit.status) and [FAQ](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.feature-article&articleId=272) for details. [Campfire restrictions](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.feature-article&articleId=285) may be in place due to high fire danger.
* Face coverings are required in [public spaces](https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le2288K.pdf). To protect our communities, we ask everyone to follow Oregon’s [Safe+Strong guidelines](https://govstatus.egov.com/reopening-oregon).
* Stay home if you feel sick or have any flu-like symptoms (obviously).
* Practice physical distancing. Stick with only members of your group and limit contact with non-household members.
* Looking for some social distancing options in Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston? [Here are some great ideas](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/five-fun-ways-to-social-distance-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/)!
* Bring all essentials to avoid unnecessary stops and additional points of contact. Bring all the supplies needed including the [Ten Essentials](https://www.nps.gov/articles/10essentials.htm), hand sanitizer, face coverings, money for park fees and gas. Pack out what you pack in and help us keep our parks clean and ready for the next visitors.
* Keep a [distance of six feet](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html) or more between yourself and others outside of your group. According to [standard trail etiquette](https://www.rei.com/blog/hike/trail-etiquette-who-has-the-right-of-way), hikers coming uphill have the right of way.
* Do not linger in parking lots, trailheads, or boat ramps. Parking areas, trailheads, and boat ramps can get crowded quickly, hindering emergency and residential access. Park your car in designated areas only.
* Keep pets leashed with a 6-feet distance from other people and animals. The CDC reports that pets can contract COVID-19.
