Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast is a haven for foodies and sport eaters alike. You may have seen our [top five Coos Bay eateries to hit up in 2016](/2015/12/five-coos-bay-restaurants-to-try-in-2016/), and the time has come for us to reveal our top 5 restaurants that North Bend has to offer this new year. From Seafood to Pancakes to Italian to Mediterranean, North Bend will have you spoiled for choice come time to dine out.

### <u>1) Ciccarelli&#8217;s</u>

This Italian restaurant/bakery is touted by patrons as not only the best Italian you will find in North Bend but instead the best you&#8217;ll find in the entire Oregon Coast area! A charming interior and stunning garden patio ensure you&#8217;ll find your zen while dining here.  Must-tries include the French onion soup, prawns, and wood-fire roasted artisanal pizzas.

One customer notes &#8220;the steak and prawns we ordered were out of this world good. Haven&#8217;t had a steak like that in years. Perfectly seasoned and beautiful medium cooked steak, big juicy prawns and a house Merlot to blend it all together.&#8221; If that doesn&#8217;t get your mouth watering then nothing will. They sum up Ciccarelli&#8217;s perfectly: &#8220;Pretty darn dreamy.&#8221;

### <u>2) The Liberty Pub</u>

Some days you just need to kick back and relax. On those days, there&#8217;s one place you should go: The Liberty Pub. Though the laid back atmosphere is great, it&#8217;s the menu that steals the spotlight. A great selection of beers, fish and chips, shepherds pie, pub rolls, pizza, and more await you in this pub.

Of course, for those days you want a little more excitement, The Liberty Pub also provides live music! Great food and great tunes ensure this place is THE place to relax after a long day at work.

### <u>3) Cafe Mediterranean</u>

Wait, authentic Mediterranean cuisine in North Bend? You&#8217;d better believe it! Cafe Mediterranean&#8217;s authentic Lebanese cuisine and tremendous service make it a must visit for anyone passing through. With delectable Shawarmas, incredible dips (Spicy feta dip! Spinach and Artichoke dip!), and unbeatable gyros and kabobs, this place is a must for any foodie looking to stray from the norm.

&#8220;Back in the day, when we&#8217;d drive through Coos Bay and North Bend, our only options were burgers, burgers, and more burgers. But not anymore. This place is amazing!&#8221; A visitor from California writes. &#8221; We&#8217;ll definitely stop here again when we&#8217;re on the coast. It was nice to find such a little jewel of a restaurant in such an unexpected place.&#8221;

### <u>4) Yeong&#8217;s Place</u>

When the taste for good burgers takes hold, nothing else will do. That&#8217;s why Yeong&#8217;s Place is as popular as it is, known for making the best burgers in North Bend (and beyond)! With a variety of meats available such as elk, bison, and salmon and a large selection of toppings and burger styles, you&#8217;re bound to find the perfect burger for you at Yeong&#8217;s. Take it from us, you can&#8217;t go beat the Garbage Burger and sweet potato fries.

&#8220;It&#8217;s quite hard to put into words just how good burgers are from Yeong&#8217;s. It&#8217;s like I would want heaven to be when I die I guess. Simply amazing every time I go.&#8221;

### <u>5) Pancake Mill Restaurant and Pie Shoppe</u>

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think it was possible to find a five-star pancake house, but this place represents the kind of food all pancake houses should aspire to achieve.&#8221; That really tells you all you need to know about the Pancake Mill Restaurant. It&#8217;s no surprise that at 190 reviews, Pancake Mill Restaurant stands as North Bend&#8217;s top rated restaurant on [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g51993-North_Bend_Oregon.html).

An assortment of delicious baked goods (did somebody say giant muffins?) and breakfast platters complete with homemade fruit syrups await you at the Pancake Mill. The real star of the show, however, is the Dutch Apple Pancake, a must try for any patron of the Pancake Mill.  Bring a big appetite when you visit or you may end up taking food home with you! But really, would that be so wrong?

So there you have it! Our top five North Bend restaurants to try in 2016. Of course, there&#8217;s plenty of more excellent options you can also find in [North Bend](/eat-drink/town/north-bend/).  Bon appetit!
