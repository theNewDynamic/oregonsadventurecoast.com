The amazing network of cultural attractions, museums and galleries on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** is one of the best kept secrets on Oregon’s South Coast - until now! Since opening in 2010, thousands of residents and visitors of Oregon’s Adventure Coast have made the short drive to Bandon to experience the [Washed Ashore Project](https://www.washedashore.org/), one of the most powerful and captivating community-driven art projects in the country. You can imagine our joy when we learned that the organization **has opened a facility in North Bend! Pony Village Mall** is the location of an expanded workshop area where residents and visitors can help craft sculptures made from trash that washes up on our beaches.

The Washed Ashore Project has soared in popularity by driving their mission of saving oceans and waterways from pollution with powerful and aesthetically pleasing sculptures created from plastic debris that have quite literally washed ashore. In addition to educational programming and environmental activism, this beloved non-profit organizes regular beach clean-ups to collect trash and plastic debris that is used to create large-scale sculptures of sea life threatened by the debris. Several of these sculptures have become part of a traveling educational exhibit hosted by aquariums, zoos, museums and science centers (including [Disney’s Epcot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMiwfreo2yU)) all over the country. The organization also partners with schools and local organizations to spread the word about plastics pollution and to teach us to become better stewards of our lands and seascapes.

Washed Ashore is receiving much deserved wide-spread praise, and has caught the attention of major news organizations like [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/arts/design/ocean-plastic-sculpture.html), and has recently been featured on national programs like [The Kelly Clarkson Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFcCCB4oQr8&amp;feature=youtu.be), [The Planetary Press](https://www.theplanetarypress.com/2021/03/podcast-angela-pozzi-founder-and-artistic-director-of-the-washed-ashore-project/), and [PBS,](https://www.pbs.org/video/washed-ashore-msyu9c/) just to name a few. Watch as Washed Ashore founder and artist Angela Haseltine Pozzi discusses her mission to raise awareness about the significant problems of plastic pollution in Earth’s oceans in a recent [Nautica Wavemakers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNnKkLEnMA-580XJ5fb6Adg) video:
