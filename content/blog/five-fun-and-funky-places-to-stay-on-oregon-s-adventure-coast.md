Five Fun and Funky Places to Stay on Oregon’s Adventure Coast

There is nothing ordinary about Oregon's South Coast. We have unique people, stores, restaurants, and attractions! Naturally, many of our local lodging establishments will offer Oregon Coast visitors a more eclectic experience than one typically encounters. In this post, we are highlighting a few of the "funkier" hotels in our area that will appeal to travelers looking for a more authentic local experience during their travels to Oregon's Adventure Coast.

### **#1-** [**The Itty Bitty Inn**](http://www.ittybittyinn.com)

This funky 1950’s hotel located in North Bend is a local treasure. With just five comfy rooms, this little gem is not your average hotel stay; it’s an experience! Each room is carefully curated to give guests a sense of local beach life, culture and whimsy. Rooms come equipped with locally made soaps, chocolates, coffees, and tea. Guest amenities also include coffee presses, growlers, and glassware for craft brewed treats! One recent visitor described her The Itty Bitty Inn experience with this review:

“Adorable.  If you like shabby chic, this is the place for you!  Each room furnished with a different decade theme, with furnishings and decor from that time period.  My 70's room even had a working Atari video game console!  The owner enthusiastically caters to your comfort and entertainment. But make reservations ahead, there are only 5 rooms.”

### **#2-** [**The Old Tower House Bed & Breakfast**](http://www.oldtowerhouse.com)

Visitors cannot get enough of this charming B&B located in Coos Bay’s Empire District. This circa-1870s tower-house is the oldest standing structure in Coos Bay and features lovely antiques as well as shabby-chic rooms & apartments. Guests enjoy the friendly service as well as a 4-minute walk to the ocean and proximity to the top local attractions. Read what some of them have written recently about this lovely Coos Bay establishment.

“This B&B is clean, comfortable and managed by a very friendly couple. The coffee was delicious and the breakfast was filling and scrumptious! I stayed one night and felt very safe, welcomed and comfortable!”

“The Old Tower House B&B is the oldest extant structure in Coos Bay, and is run by a friendly couple who have put their heart into the place. Although the rooms are furnished with period pieces, the interior appears to have undergone major renovations.”

### **#3-** [**Coos Bay Manor**](https://www.coosbaymanor.com/en-us)


Built in 1912, this grand colonial-style B&B featuring elegant cozy antiques-filled rooms,  late 19th-century charm, high ceilings, free WiFi & full breakfast is adored by visitors. Guests are treated to a glass of wine upon arrival along with a delicious breakfast the next morning. The Coos Bay Manor is also within walking distance of restaurants and often described by visitors as romantic, timeless, accommodating, comfortable and clean.

“What a wonderful place for a stay,” says a recent visitor. “Exceptionally clean, Very pleasant hosts. Exceptional place for a one night or an extended stay. A free glass of wine if you so desire. You will not be disappointed with your stay”.

### **#4-** [**Captain John's Motel**](https://capitanjohnsmotel.wixsite.com/captjohnsmotel)


Planning on doing some crabbing, clamming or fishing while you’re here? You can’t go wrong with this no-nonsense motel featuring excellent service, fair prices, convenience, basic but clean rooms and fish-cleaning station among other things! It’s just a 6-minute walk to Charleston Marina Complex, 2 miles from Bastendorff Beach County Park and 3 miles from Sunset Bay State Park.

“Fantastic little hotel in beautiful Charleston,” writes one visitor. “It's very quiet and caters to the fishing crowd, though it's welcoming for anyone. Kitchens are offered and the rooms are basic, clean and warm. The prices are more than fair.” Another guest writes “Not a bad little place. Right on the marina, fish cleaning building, within walking distance of stores, restaurants and the Maritime Museum \[Charleston Marine Life Center\]. Basic rooms but very comfortable.” What more can you ask for?

### **#5-** [**The Bay Point Landing**](https://www.baypointlanding.com)


Eager to try “glamping”? If you are looking to reconnect with nature, but not quite ready for “roughing it”, The Bay Point Landing might be just the place for you! Nestled on 103 acres sanctuary in Coos Bay, this local gem is a destination for visitors wanting a unique, contemporary camping experience. The park is equipped with modern cabins, RV spots, and Airstreams along with comfortable amenities, adventure, and lovely beachfront views. Experience the outdoors on a whole new level!

One reviewer writes that “It's a great up and coming place, sets the bar higher for an RV park, all new facilities, big spaces, and almost 0 noise pollution, is currently having work completed on north lot, the south lot is amazing, cool ocean breeze, and smell. If a coastal getaway in your RV is a must, this is the place to go.”
