***“Our market programs support local businesses and help provide fresh, healthy food to everyone, putting food back into the community.”*** **—Coos Bay Farmers Market**

The [CBDA Coos Bay Farmers Market (CBFM)](https://www.facebook.com/CoosBayFarmersMarket) is celebrating a significant milestone this season! For a quarter of a century, this beloved community event has brought local farmers, artisans, businesses, organizations, food vendors, members of the community, and visitors together nearly every Wednesday, May through October.

Through the years, the CBFM has evolved into a community staple on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, offering residents and visitors the chance to engage directly with local vendors and support small businesses as they stroll through the heart of Coos Bay’s historic downtown district.

“For 25 years, we’ve come together to support our local farmers, artisans, and small businesses,” say market organizers. “It’s not just about fresh food and handmade goods; it’s about the people of our community who make this place special.” Not only is this accessible, open-air venue a highlight for residents, but it has also become popular with visitors looking to experience local culture and food.

“Just moved to Coos Bay from Spain after being gone from Oregon for 25 years...if there's one thing we were going to miss from Europe, it's all the villages with a central downtown area closed to traffic,” writes one local resident [in this review](https://g.co/kgs/KFtmkvS). “CB Farmers Market Association NAILED IT with this function...Great Vendors, Great Music, Friendly People, A Great Vibe! One more reason we're glad we settled here!”

We can’t think of a better way to experience the very best of the unique, welcoming community spirit on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston.

### Brief History

Founded in 2000 by the [Coos Bay Downtown Association (CBDA)](https://coosbaydowntown.com/), the CBFM has grown from a handful of local vendors into the largest farmers market on the Southern Oregon Coast, serving Coos, Douglas, and Curry counties.

In 2024, it grew from 115 to 145 vendors to keep the market fresh and full of variety for all who attend. “We learned that having more vendors created extra space, offered more products, and attracted more visitors, making the market more successful,” says the market organizers.

Its mission is to provide an accessible venue for local farmers, artisans, and mobile restaurant owners to sell their produce and products while enriching the local community. The market also offers a range of food accessibility programs including SNAP/EBT (also accepted from out-of-state visitors), Double Up Food Bucks, WIC, Senior Vouchers, and more all in support of its mission to bring “Farm Fresh to Every Fork” and ensure everyone can enjoy the bounty of the Southern Oregon Coast.

### What the CBFM Offers

### Why Farmers’ Markets Like CBFM Matter

![](/img/coos-bay-farmers-market-25-years-1.jpg)

When you shop at local Farmers’ Markets like CBFM, you directly support local businesses and farmers, helping local families thrive and strengthening the area’s economy. Here are some other benefits:

**They build real connections.** Farmers’ markets create space for neighbors to meet, vendors to share their stories, and communities to grow closer. It’s not just shopping, it’s a social experience.

**The food is just better.** Most produce is harvested within a day or two of the market, so it’s fresher, more flavorful, and often healthier than what you’d find at a grocery store.

**They’re better for the planet.** Local shopping means less long-distance transport and fewer emissions. Many vendors also use organic or low-impact farming methods.

**You learn, and often save.** Talking to farmers gives you a better understanding of what you’re eating. Plus, while prices vary, you can often find great deals, especially on seasonal produce.

### How to Get the Most Out of Your Farmers’ Market Trip

Shopping at a local farmers’ market like the CBDA Coos Bay Farmers Market is a great way to enjoy a unique community experience. Here are a few tips to make the most of your visit.

**Come prepared.** Some vendors might take cards, but many prefer cash for small purchases. Don’t forget reusable bags and a cooler if you’re buying perishable items.

**Time it right.** Show up early for the best selection or later in the day for potential deals as vendors clear out leftover stock. Both times have their perks.

**Scout before you shop.** Walk the whole market before buying. It gives you a good overview of what’s available and lets you compare quality and prices.

**Talk and learn.** Vendors are a great source of info! Ask how something was grown, how to store it, or what to cook with it. It makes the food more interesting and the trip more fun.

**Be flexible.** Try new or "ugly" produce—it’s usually just as good and sometimes cheaper. If something’s in season, consider buying extra to freeze, can, or share.

We invite you to visit the market during the 2025 season and experience the local culture and cuisine of Oregon's Adventure Coast!
