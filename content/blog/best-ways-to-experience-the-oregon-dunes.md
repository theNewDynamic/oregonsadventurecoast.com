There's lots to love about Oregon's Adventure Coast, but some would say that the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, the largest expanse of coastal dunes in North America, is what truly sets us apart from other travel destinations.

Whether you are seeking an off-roading adventure on a quad or ATV, a good hike, natural photo opportunities, camping, or simply seeking some peace and quiet- you will find it somewhere in the 32,186 acres of dunes, forest, streams and lakes.

“Just the massiveness of this area is worth the stop,” says a visitor on TripAdvisor. “Just going there to sit in the sand and reflect on the beauty and the music that the ocean offers. The sunsets are breathtaking and it just gives you a chance to get away from all the hustle, noise, devices and crazy that our current lives offer. What an experience.”

Even travel journalist, Rick Dancer, had this to say on [ExplOregon The Back Stories:](https://www.facebook.com/ExplOregon-The-Back-Stories-110944429810670/)
