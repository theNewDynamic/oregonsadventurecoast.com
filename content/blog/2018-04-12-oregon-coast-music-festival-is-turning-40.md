<h4>The Coast Comes Alive with Sounds of Music July 24th-28th, 2018</h4>

The longest running music festival on the Oregon Coast is turning 40! The 40th Annual <a href="http://www.oregoncoastmusic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oregon Coast Music Festival</a> is happening<strong> Tuesday, July 24th through Saturday, July 28th, 2018.</strong>



The Oregon Coast Music Festival (OCMF) had its beginnings in 1978, when Dr. Charles Heiden and his family moved to Coos Bay with the idea of encouraging local children to learn about orchestral music. Heiden, who had previously served as professor of violin at Willamette University, came to the coast to plant the seeds of appreciation for this music.



The only festival of its kind in southwestern Oregon, OCMF has been listed on TravelMag.Com's <a href="http://www.travelmag.com/articles/festivals-oregon-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">List of Best Festivals </a> and has even caught the attention of <a href="http://www.frommers.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel Guru Arthur Frommer </a> who said he was "bowled over by its ambitions and quality" and had this to say about our area:



"The Oregon coast is one of the most under-rated tourist attractions in America; its visitors, though substantial in number, are nowhere near what it should be receiving. The coast is largely underdeveloped, and is awesome in its natural wonders and beauty, its many state parks, its quaint seaside towns….with high-quality seafood restaurants."



Each year, the highlight of OCMF has been the outstanding performances given by the one-and-only Festival Orchestra, an 80-piece professional orchestra comprised of elite regional, national and international musicians. James Paul, Conductor and Music Director of the Festival Orchestra since 1991, is widely acclaimed as one of North America’s most esteemed conductors. Listening to these talented musicians perform under the direction of world-class conductors is a special opportunity for South Coast residents and visitors to experience classical music as it was intended to be heard.



This year's festival will feature a special pre-festival jazz concert from the Darrell Grant Combo in addition to three classical concerts performed by the official Festival Symphony Orchestra.
