## Come Spend a Safe [Christmas at the Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/christmas-at-the-coast/) this Holiday Season!

The pandemic may have broken our hearts this year, but it didn’t break our spirit! We are happy to tell you that the holiday spirit on Oregon’s Adventure Coast lives on. Things may look a little different this year, but there are plenty of reasons to join us to celebrate the season. It is true that for the first time in 34 years, Shore Acres State Park will be dark due to the potential risk to the health and safety of volunteers, visitors, and park staff. In fact, it is just one of many new norms and adjustments we have had to make this year, but just like every dark cloud in an Oregon sky, there IS a silver lining.

Our innovative local holiday elves have found a way for us to be together, while maintaining a safe distance and health protocols as recommended by our public health organizations. From Thanksgiving night to New Year’s Eve 2020, neighborhoods and business districts throughout Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston will light up for the holidays! You can pick up a map from the Coos Bay and North Bend Visitor Information Centers and delight in the sights of Christmas as you drive around our beautiful communities. If you are staying at one of our lodging properties during this time, bring your receipt to either visitor center to receive a special commemorative ornament!

But that’s not all. Other holiday events for 2020 include:

**November 13th-14, 2020:** [Holiday Open House in downtown Coos Bay](https://www.facebook.com/events/710242702942595) (Save your shopping receipts from downtown Coos Bay businesses from November 13th through November 28th to receive a commemorative mug when you spend more than $100!

For those of you who feel as if it’s not the holiday season without an annual visit to the Shore Acres Holiday Lights Display, we get it! That’s why the [Friends of Shore Acres ](https://shoreacres.net/about-us/about-friends-of-shore-acres-inc/)have released a new video created by Allan Ledesma of Epuerto- [click here to view it](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/christmas-at-the-coast/).
