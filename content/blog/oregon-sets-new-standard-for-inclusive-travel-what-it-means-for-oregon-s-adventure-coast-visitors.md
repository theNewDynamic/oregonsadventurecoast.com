#### Oregon Has Become the First State to Earn "Accessibility Verified" Status From Wheel the World, a Milestone That Makes Visiting Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston More Inclusive Than Ever.

Oregon is widely known as the pioneer state, and thanks to a partnership between[<u>Travel Oregon</u>](https://traveloregon.com/) and[<u>Wheel the World</u>](https://wheeltheworld.com/), it has lived up to its reputation once more. Travel Oregon has announced that Oregon has become the first state in the U.S. to be designated by [Wheel the World as "Accessibility Verified"](https://industry.traveloregon.com/programs/accessible-travel/wheel-the-world-program/), a milestone in inclusive travel! **Oregon’s Adventure Coast**, along with a dozen other coastal communities, is also [Destination Verified by Wheel the World](https://wheeltheworld.com/accessible-travel/usa/oregon/coos-bay).

This milestone aligns with our vision that everyone who visits **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, and surrounding communities can experience its exquisite beauty and unique experiences without barriers, regardless of ability.

"Traveling with a disability often means facing the unknown," said Alvaro Silberstein, CEO & Co-founder of Wheel the World. "Our vision is to remove uncertainty and establish trust by helping every destination verify, improve, and promote accessibility—creating real impact for travelers with disabilities and measurable returns for communities. By becoming the first state to achieve Accessibility Verified status, Oregon is setting a precedent and proving how powerful this cycle can be for travelers and for the communities that welcome them."

<br>Shane Burcaw is well aware of the challenges disabled travelers face. There's uncertainty in any new location when it comes to transportation, restrooms, hotel rooms, dining spaces, and more, not to mention navigating through busy airports and pathways. So when he and his wife,[<u>Hannah Burcaw</u>](https://www.instagram.com/hannahayl/?hl=en), took a trip to Oregon in spring 2025, they were delighted to have what he calls a "stress-free experience" thanks to the state's newest efforts to welcome travelers of all mobilities.

"As we traveled along the Coast, there were so many areas where I was able to get right up in the thick of nature right in my wheelchair, and that is not always the case," says Burcaw, who lives with spinal muscular atrophy and uses a power wheelchair. "Being able to really feel like I was out there experiencing nature in its fullest form was really a special feeling for me and Hannah." Travel Oregon featured their itinerary along the Oregon Coast, including accessible destinations on Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston!

*One good place to start is the*[*<u>Coos Bay Boardwalk</u>*](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/cities/coos-bay/activities/coos-bay-boardwalk/)*, a short stretch of wood plank pier that includes a fish market, historic displays, public artwork, and views of the bay. Follow the accessible path as far as you like, and grab a seat inside at*[*<u>7 Devils Waterfront Alehouse</u>*](https://7devilsbrewery.com/waterfront-ale-house/)*, one of the region's top brewpubs. Find a step-free entrance, accessible dining area, accessible parking and accessible restrooms. The menu includes high-quality seafood caught by local fishers; try the Coos Bay oysters, smoked fish trio or beer-battered Oregon rockfish fish n' chips. The brewpub is part of the*[*<u>Wild Rivers Coast Food Trail</u>*](https://www.wrcfoodtrail.com/)*, a self-guided journey to top spots for berries, seafood and dreamy ocean landscapes.*

### What Does This Mean for People With Disabilities Who Travel to Oregon's Adventure Coast?

Being [Destination Verified by "Wheel the World"](https://wheeltheworld.com/accessible-travel/usa/oregon/coos-bay?srsltid=AfmBOoogzxMKVgV9NBFGTjOZxYEDWGrqe3Vuuh2mxf__EZQ3gTo3bnPz)means that visitors with disabilities and mobility challenges can [plan their trips through an online resource](https://blog.wheeltheworld.com/where-to-stay-and-what-to-do-in-coos-bay-and-their-accessibility/) designed with accessibility in mind. Making this region more accessible and inclusive has long been a priority for Coos Bay–North Bend–Charleston Visitor & Convention Bureau Director, Janice Langlinais. "We are proud that the VCB and its partners continue to seek solutions for visitors with mobility and visual challenges, allowing them to enjoy the natural amenities that make Oregon's Adventure Coast such a special place to visit," she says.

From lodging and outdoor adventures to cultural and culinary experiences, the VCB is collaborating with partners like the[<u>Oregon Coast Visitors Association (OCVA)</u>](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/) and other tourism collaborators to enhance accessibility across all sectors, ensuring everyone can enjoy [the Oregon Coast](https://wheeltheworld.com/accessible-travel/usa/oregon/oregon-coast). "While there's more work ahead, we remain dedicated to removing barriers and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to enjoy our very special part of the coast," says Langlinais.

### What We Are Doing

* On **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, several local businesses have completed accessibility assessments and now proudly display their "Accessibility Verified" status. Visitors can find guides like[<u>Coos Bay Accessibility Insights: Where to Stay and What to Do,</u>](https://blog.wheeltheworld.com/where-to-stay-and-what-to-do-in-coos-bay-and-their-accessibility/) giving travelers with mobility challenges the tools they need to explore our region confidently.
* Thanks to the generous support of local organizations,[<u>David's Chair Outdoor Mobility Systems</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/oregon-s-adventure-coast-boosts-accessibility-for-outdoor-recreation/) is now available to reserve and use for free. These rugged, track-based chairs allow individuals to explore once-inaccessible destinations such as local beaches, state parks, and trails. Unlike traditional wheelchairs, these all-terrain chairs feature durable, tank-like tracks that can navigate sand, gravel, and uneven ground. And thanks to a recent grant from Travel Oregon, a new and improved track chair is now available for visitors to reserve. This more beach-friendly chair is housed at the Coos Bay Visitor Center, along with a tow-and-go trailer for transporting the chair. For more information on David's Chair,[<u>visit the website</u>](https://davidschair.org/) or contact the Coos Bay-North Bend-Charleston Visitor & Convention Bureau at [info@visitoac.com](mailto:info@visitoac.com).
* Accessible kayak launches at[<u>William M. Tugman State Park</u>](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=69) and[<u>John Topits Park,</u>](https://www.coosbayor.gov/community/city-parks/john-topits-park-empire-lakes)<u> </u>and accessible viewing platforms, enable individuals with mobility challenges to access places along the water that once felt out of reach.
* Oregon's Adventure Coast now offers[<u>EnChroma</u>](https://enchroma.com/) outdoor glasses for both the most common and rarer forms of color blindness. These glasses are available for adults and children and can be borrowed for free for up to seven days from the Coos Bay Visitor Center. Additionally,[<u>Coos Art Museum</u>](https://coosartmuseum.org/),[<u>Coos History Museum</u>](https://cooshistory.org/), and the[<u>Charleston Marine Life Center</u>](https://cmlc.uoregon.edu/) have indoor EnChroma glasses available for visitors to borrow free of charge during their visit to the museums.
* In May 2025, Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston was proud to be a local sponsor of the[Accessible Oregon Coast Film Tour](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/industry-news/thats-a-wrap-on-the-accessible-oregon-coast-film-tour/), an inspiring series of events presented by[<u>Oregon Coast Visitors Association (OCVA)</u>](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/) that brought together accessibility advocates, tourism leaders, and Oregon Coast communities to spotlight progress and ignite new ideas. The tour showcased three powerful short films created by[GLP Films](https://www.glpfilms.com/) and funded by[Travel Oregon](https://traveloregon.com/), each highlighting the people and partnerships making the Oregon Coast more inclusive for everyone. You can read more about this special event by[<u>clicking here</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/proud-sponsors-of-progress-accessible-oregon-coast-film-tour/).

The partnership with[<u>Wheel the World</u>](https://wheeltheworld.com/accessible-travel/usa/oregon) is part of Travel Oregon's broader strategy to ensure Oregon is a welcoming destination for all. "Earning the distinction of being the first Accessibility Verified state reflects Oregon's deep and ongoing commitment to welcoming all travelers," said Kevin Wright, VP of Brand Stewardship at Travel Oregon. "Through this designation, we're building a tourism landscape where inclusion is meaningful and central to the visitor experience." By broadening accessibility information, the program ensures travelers with disabilities and accessibility needs have clear, reliable information and welcoming experiences across our state. This milestone reflects a coordinated statewide effort to evaluate and improve the accessibility of tourism businesses in all seven of Oregon's tourism regions.

### **About the Program**

Wheel the World (WTW) is an online travel platform that supports people with disabilities in finding, booking, and enjoying accessible destinations. In November 2024, Travel Oregon teamed up with WTW to assess over 300 businesses in 21 communities as a part of the current program.

To date, including both this program and previous assessments, more than 750 hotels, restaurants, parks, transportation providers, and all[<u>Travel Oregon Welcome Centers</u>](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/visit-a-state-welcome-center/?utm_actcampaign=521178875&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=**LP%20-%20Oregon&amp;utm_term=Oregon%20Welcome%20Center&amp;utm_content=Oregon%20Welcome%20Center) across 43 communities (with more to come) have been evaluated. This work sets Oregon apart as a destination that provides evidence-based and measurement-backed accessibility information. All evaluated businesses can be found on[<u>Travel Oregon's Accessible Travel</u>](https://traveloregon.com/accessible-travel/) page and[<u>Wheel the World</u>](https://wheeltheworld.com/accessible-travel/usa/oregon).
