The City of North Bend is celebrating its 121st birthday by bringing back the [Annual July Jubilee](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/north-bend-july-jubilee/) July 12-14, 2024. The beloved community festival, organized by the city’s Special Events Committee, has been on hiatus since 2019 and we are so ready for its historic comeback!

This year’s July Jubilee celebrates the unique spirit of North Bend and is poised to be one of the highlights of the summer on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**. “The July Jubilee is not just a celebration of North Bend’s rich history and its wonderful residents, but also aims to attract visitors from near and far,” says festival organizers. “By offering a wide range of activities over three days, we hope to engage our local community and encourage residents to invite friends and family to join in the festivities.”

Festivities will include a Disc Golf Tournament at Ferry Road Park, family activities at Pony Village Mall and North Bend Library, a Cornhole Tournament at North Bend Lanes/Back Alley Pub, a walking tour, a softball game, activities at North Bend Visitor Center, a Sip N Stroll, and more!
