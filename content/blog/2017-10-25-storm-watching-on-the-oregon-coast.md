October is here and that means "<a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/featured-adventures/stormwatching/">storm watching </a>season" is upon us!  The massive waves (some reaching up to 120 feet high!) resulting from Pacific storms that rage during the fall and winter months put on quite a show. One could spend hours gazing at the Pacific Ocean’s majestic fury and it's dramatic waves. It's a little-known secret that some of the best storm watching spots on the Oregon Coast are right in our backyard!

The best time to go is when swells are predicted to be high so be sure to check the local, extended forecast. It's exciting to get close to the action, <strong>but we need you to stay safe! Never ever turn your back to the ocean and always watch from safe viewing areas</strong>.


<a title="Shore Acres State Park" href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/shore-acres-state-park/">Shore Acres State Park</a> has a designated viewing area just for ocean gazers and storm watchers offering magnificent views. On rainy days, there is a storm watching hut to keep visitors safe and dry. Here are a couple of great videos we captured a couple of seasons ago from <a href="http://www.shoreacres.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shore Acres State Park</a>. The gigantic Pacific Ocean waves breaking across the cliffs are so spectacular, it's worth sharing again!

Another great local storm watching spot from the bluff overlooking <a title="Bastendorff Beach" href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/bastendorff-beach/">Bastendorff Beach</a> and <a href="http://www.oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunset Bay State Park</a> along <a href="http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/itineraries/2-cape-arago-beach-loop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cape Arago Highway</a>. Sunset Bay State Park features a protected beach, with tidepools exposed at low tide. The beach is probably the safest beach to walk on in winter, due to its geography, with land on three sides and an island that slows incoming waves.

Follow these tips to stay safe &amp; dry!
<ul>
 	<li>It can get pretty wet so make sure you pack quality rain gear to waterproof yourself and your loved ones. Light, waterproof jackets and sweaters help to keep the cool damp wind out.</li>
 	<li>Dress in layers as the temperature will fluctuate.</li>
 	<li>If you plan to hike and explore, we encourage you to also bring hiking boots (waterproof ones are the best).</li>
 	<li>You will most definitely want to snap some pics of the storm.  It is not a bad idea to invest in a quality digital camera that is completely waterproof.</li>
 	<li>Binoculars are also a good idea if you have them.</li>
 	<li>Bring money for parking at different destinations (it's $5 to park at Shore Acres).</li>
 	<li>Avoid bringing valuables that could be lost or damaged like small electronic devices and computers.</li>
