**Oregon's Adventure Coast** is known as a destination where the rugged beauty of the Pacific Northwest meets coastal hospitality and endless adventure. Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, we wanted to round up some of our favorite breakfast/brunch spots where visitors can fuel up for a big day of adventure. From bustling restaurants serving up traditional breakfast/brunch favorites to locally owned coffee houses, we've curated a list of brunch spots that capture the friendly, relaxed essence of **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** (listed in alphabetical order)**\:**
