### "Many go fishing all their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after." - Henry David Thoreau

Kayak fishing is more popular than ever on Oregon’s South Coast, and with the [10th Annual Sunset Bay Angler Of The Day Kayak Fishing Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/sunset-bay-state-park/10th-annual-sunset-bay-angler-of-the-day-kayak-fishing-challenge/1213726548778689/) coming up August 24th, we thought this would the perfect time to share some answers to commonly asked questions about kayak fishing on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

**What’s so special about kayak fishing, you may ask?** Many people will say that they are drawn to this growing watersport for the purpose of ease and simplicity. You are not required to buy or rent expensive equipment and the sport is accessible to anglers of all skill levels. “Most fishing kayaks will float in 6" of water while holding up to 350 pounds of cargo,” writes Jerry White in [_Why Fish From a Kayak_](https://paddling.com/learn/why-fish-from-a-kayak/). “Not only does that make it easier to get on the water, but usually these places aren't accessible to conventional boats, either by law (designated as a "No Motor Zone") or by nature itself. .

In addition to being more accessible, kayak fishing offers serenity and unsurpassed views of natural habitats and scenery that can only be found deep in the lakes, rivers and open water along the Pacific coastline.

* [Sunset Bay State Park](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=70) is a local favorite among kayakers. Known for its calm waters and easy access to the beach, Sunset Bay State Park is an ideal location for kayak anglers who want to head offshore into the ocean in search of cabezon, lingcod, and halibut.
* The calm waters in nearby Woahink, Siltcoos, Lake Marie or Saunders lakes are good for bass, trout and perch.
* The Umpqua, Coos or Coquille rivers are ideal destinations for kayakers who are searching for chinook salmon.

**When is the best time to go?** Depending on the weather forecast, anglers of all skill levels can easily access the lakes and rivers and ocean waters (via Sunset Bay State Park) on Oregon’s South Coast any time of the year. When you go also depends on what species of fish you’re after. [Download our Fishing Information Rack Card here (PDF)](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/rackcard-fishing-03-18.pdf).
