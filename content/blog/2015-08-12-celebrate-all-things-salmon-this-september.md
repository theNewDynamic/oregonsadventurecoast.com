If you love Salmon as much as we do, September is a great time to travel to Oregon&#8217;s South Coast! Not only is <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/featured-adventures/fishing-crabbing-clamming/" target="_blank">Chinook Salmon season</a> at it&#8217;s peak, there will be 2 events celebrating salmon the 2nd weekend in September.

&#8220;For me, one of the surest signs of transition from summer to fall is the many places you might cast a lure or drift bait for salmon along coastal Oregon,&#8221; says Travel Oregon&#8217;s Grant McOmie in <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/downtown-coos-bay-salmon/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">this post</a>.

Hundreds of visitors are expected to turn out for the very popular <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.themillcasino.com/entertainment/salmon.cfm" target="_blank" class="broken_link"> 12th Annual Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration</a> and the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/14th-annual-coos-basin-amateur-salmon-derby/" target="_blank">Annual Coos Basin Amateur Salmon Derby</a> September 12th-13th, 2015.

### The Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration

The Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration offers visitors the opportunity to experience Native American culture, art, food and music. It features free daily performances by Native American storytellers, drummers, flutists and dancers, a marketplace offering traditional wares and foods, a bay-front canoe exhibit and races, traditional games and activities for children, plus a variety of cultural demonstrations and educational exhibits.



The celebration is perhaps best known for it&#8217;s traditional salmon bake dinner where fresh salmon is prepared in the time-honored Coquille open-pit manner.
