**There’s a Reason Shore Acres State Park is known as the “Jewel of the South Coast”**

One could argue that the glorious beaches and state parks found along the [Cape Arago Beach Loop](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) are the greatest treasures on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston - but one of these state parks seems to always stand out from the rest: Shore Acres State Park. The well-kept grounds, hiking trails and gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean are nothing short of grand, but it is the glorious gardens of [Shore Acres State Park](http://shoreacres.net/) that inspire visitors and locals alike to refer to it as “the jewel of the South Coast”. Perched high above the Pacific on rugged sandstone cliffs, Shore Acres features lush gardens with plants and flowers from all over the world.

> “Everything about this park is absolutely breathtaking,” a [local guide](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAWPBA_enUS797US797&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk018tA_rlh7zAZtnuBsRdtfZsO-GYA%3A1599583019089&amp;ei=K7NXX8WFBYeGytMPn4aaoA4&amp;q=shore+acres+state+park+&amp;oq=shore+acres+state+park+&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIECCMQJzIECCMQJzIHCAAQFBCHAjICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEdQog9Yog9g4hFoAHABeACAAWqIAWqSAQMwLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFx5CN_9nrAhUHg3IEHR-DBuQQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5#lrd=0x54c378b8051ea9cd:0x7a3dd8fc1f71112c,1,,,) writes in her Google Review in August of 2020. “The vistas of the ocean are stunning, the gardens fragrant and gorgeous, the wooded trails are dappled in sunlight and greenery, the jagged rocky coast and deep dark blue ocean with those beautiful white wave crests. The smell of salt in the air. I simply can't even put into words how beautiful and peaceful it is here, it's my absolute favorite and truly a gem of the Oregon coast.”

What began as a luxurious private estate that belonged to lumber and shipping tycoon, Louis Simpson, has become a beloved local treasure filled with history and beauty for all to enjoy. The park was given the [2020 Travelers’ Choice award by Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51813-d105581-Reviews-Shore_Acres_State_Park-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html) - a special designation awarded to travel destinations that have consistently ranked within the top 10% by Tripadvisor reviewers.

Shore Acres is a “garden for all seasons’ meaning visitors can enjoy it any time of the year, but If you happen to be visiting this fall, bring your camera! Not only will you find the stunning dahlias in full bloom, but visitors will also enjoy discovering the many other unique flowers, plants, evergreen shrubs and trees (including the largest Monterey Pine in Oregon) in this beloved garden maintained by an army of dedicated [Friends of Shore Acres](http://shoreacres.net/about-us/about-friends-of-shore-acres-inc/) volunteers. One visitor even called it “[Dahlia heaven](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51813-d105581-r608482444-Shore_Acres_State_Park-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html)”:

*“What a beautiful setting. Who knew there were so many varieties of Dahlia's? The Japanese garden was very nice, but all of the interior gardens were filled with amazing Dahlias. Don't miss out.”*

In addition to exploring the gardens, visitors can take in spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean along with towering waves crashing against the shoreline and cliffs in the winter months. Whale watchers have ample opportunities to spot migrating whales during the winter and summer migrating seasons. A secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach awaits those willing to hike down the somewhat steep trail.
