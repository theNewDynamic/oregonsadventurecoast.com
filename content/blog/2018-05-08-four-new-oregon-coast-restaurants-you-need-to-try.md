Ask anyone who visits the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area and they will tell you that we love to eat. Guests of the <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visitor center</a> frequently tell us how pleasantly surprised they are about the quality of the food, service and the selection of our local dining establishments. Guess you could say it's one of the best-kept secrets on Oregon's Adventure Coast!

We're also earning a reputation for hosting some of the most delicious festivals on the coast like the upcoming annual <a href="/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBQ, Blues &amp; Brews by the Bay</a> May 25th-27th, the <a href="/event/the-mill-casino-food-truck-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mill Casino Food Truck Off</a> August 3rd-5th,the annual <a href="/event/annual-charleston-seafood-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charleston Seafood Festival</a> August 10th-12th and many others throughout the year.

Whether you're in the mood for local fresh seafood, comfort food, burgers, sushi, ethnic or pub fare- you will find it here. Most of our restaurants are locally owned and operated and are active members of the community. Many restaurant owners and staff will often chat with travelers, welcoming them and giving them an authentic sense of the history and culture in our area as well as unique ideas to get the most out of their trip.

It's exciting to see new additions to our growing restaurant scene, so here are a few you'll enjoy checking out on your next visit.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Friends-Cafe-530179044034503/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>Friends Café</h2>

As the name suggests, this community-oriented café offers friendly service along with classic American fare, burgers and sandwiches, salads, and wraps. “Come in as strangers and leave as friends. We want everybody who comes in here to have a great time, enjoy our food, and we welcome feedback,” says co-owner Debra Robertson in a<a href="http://theworldlink.com/news/local/business/friends-cafe-to-open-in-eastside-by-the-end-of/article_480369f0-211a-5df0-89fe-e9961fc3f69b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> recent World News article</a>. We've heard many positive reviews about this new spot from happy guests who recommend the fish and chips, Southfork Melt, homemade clam chowder and the Cross Road Chicken Sandwich.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Boat-1658642967582777/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><h2>The Boat</h2>

There's a saying that goes “what is old is new again" and that is certainly the case with this new Coos Bay addition. Fans of the popular floating restaurant, Unger's in Winchester Bay, will be happy to know that the restaurant has a new name and new location. The Boat (formerly Ungers) relocated next to the Railroad Museum on U.S. Highway 101 in Coos Bay just a few months ago and it's getting rave reviews. The building itself was originally a houseboat that has been converted into a restaurant with a large, new, dog-friendly deck for outside. The menu features the signature fish and chips made famous at Ungers along with delicious seafood platters, burgers, salads, chowder bread bowls and much more.

For travelers with food sensitivities or just looking for wholesome, healthier options, finding the right restaurant can be a challenge! Fortunately for us, Noster Kitchen opened in downtown Coos Bay recently and has proven to be a popular spot for breakfast and lunch. The menu is full of delicious meals and can accommodate special dietary needs including gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, vegetarian, vegan, paleo and more! Their lunch bowls are a hit with carnivores and vegans alike and all menu items are cooked from scratch using minimally processed ingredients and local, seasonal produce. "Finally fresh clean eating in Coos Bay," says this Google Local Guide. "Dog-friendly seating, too! Had the nori bowl and it was so flavorful, fresh and fast. Enjoyed sitting outside on the enclosed patio. Very attentive and friendly service. Can't wait to go back. Definitely, a place that can be Whole30 and Paleo friendly."

There is no need to travel to a large city for a fine dining experience. Perhaps one of the most exciting recent additions to the local restaurant scene is Restaurant O, led by Master <a href="http://restauranto.us/masterchef-o-neill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chef Eoghain O’Neill</a>. Even though Restaurant O has only been open for a few months, Chef O'Neill's fresh new menu and attentive staff have already received widespread accolades from visitors and locals alike. Located in the space formerly occupied by Benetti's Italian Restaurant, Restaurant O is one of the first open concept kitchens in southern Oregon and features a tapas and cocktail bar, a brasserie main dining hall and a tasting room on the upper level that overlooks the bay. Reservations are recommended.
