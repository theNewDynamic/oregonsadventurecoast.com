Whale Watch Week is not just an event; it's a chance to create cherished memories and a deeper appreciation for the Pacific ocean and the incredible marine life it supports. Visitors can marvel at these gentle giants as they breach, spout, and glide gracefully through the ocean from multiple viewpoints on the Oregon Coast, including the iconic lookout at [<u>Shore Acres State Park</u>](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=68) right here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston.&nbsp;

Oregon State Parks commemorates the annual winter and spring whale migration with its [<u>Oregon Whale Watch program</u>](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=things-to-do.whale-watching) in late December and late March. Thanks to their knowledgeable [<u>volunteers</u>](https://orwhalewatch.org/), curious visitors can learn more about the gray whales and their annual migration in [<u>designated sites</u>](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;z=7&amp;source=embed&amp;mid=1GtewyAaPhNBWUDd6wbgUNClVkOM&amp;ll=44.21568626913395%2C-124.2192685) (like [<u>Shore Acres State Park</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) ) between 10:00am - 1:00pm December 27-31, 2023 - when these volunteers assist visitors in spotting the migrating whales and help them identify their swimming patterns and habits. The program also celebrates the annual Spring Whale Watch Week in March, when nearly 20,000 gray whales return northward.&nbsp;
