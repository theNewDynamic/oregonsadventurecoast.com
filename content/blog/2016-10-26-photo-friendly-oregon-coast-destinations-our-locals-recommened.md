### Photo opps can be found everywhere in our area, you just have to keep your eyes open.

Ever been bitten by the photography bug? Most of us have. Nowadays, there are more tools than ever for aspiring photographers to capture and share their favorite moments right on their mobile devices. Whether you are a seasoned professional or an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/travelcoosbay/" target="_blank">Instagram </a>addict, Oregon&#8217;s South Coast offers a variety of stunning natural backgrounds to create unforgettable images.

&#8220;Winter Storm Watching&#8221; season will soon be here, giving nature lovers a chance to photograph the mighty Pacific in all it&#8217;s glory. We have a number of <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/2014/10/dramatic-winter-storm-watching-on-the-oregon-coast/" target="_blank">Tips for Winter Storm Watching</a> for visitors to read. A couple of months ago, we came up with a list of <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/2016/08/grab-the-camera-top-spots-for-aspiring-photographers/" target="_blank">Six Places Aspiring Photographers Must See on Oregon&#8217;s South Coast</a>.

While there are numerous places to capture an iconic Oregon Coast shot, there are several destinations you may not have thought to visit. We asked our local experts to share some of their favorite photography spots you may not have known about.

One of the tips we received was from a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook fan</a> was very specific. &#8220;Pull into parking area of the old newspaper building on 101, right on the bay,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Just wait 5 minutes, and you will see something awesome. The first thing I ever saw from there was a huge flock of egrets on the water. You never know what you will see from there.&#8221; Another fan suggests photographing &#8220;The bay itself. The little nooks and beaches tucked in along Empire make you fall in love with Coos Bay.&#8221;

If you are really devoted to getting the perfect shot, another visitor suggests going all in and camping out for it at spots like <a href="http://highwaywestvacations.com/properties/oceanside" target="_blank">Oceanside Beachfront RV Resort</a>. &#8220;Their beach cove is stunning, she says. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to stay overnight just rent a campsite for the day. You won&#8217;t regret it.&#8221; Several of you suggested the U.S. Coast Guard Station located at 63450 Kingfisher Rd in Coos Bay. &#8220;I always include the Coast Guard Look Out and walk around the area for photo opps,&#8221; says a local.

Photo opps can be found everywhere in our area, you just have to keep your eyes open. It also helps to get an early start. As one local expert advised, &#8220;Even just around the general Coos Bay/Coquille/Charleston areas, early morning fog gives beautiful scenery&#8221;.

Here are some other photo friendly places our locals recommend, Do you have any to add?

### If you are headed to the beach, watch for dangerous sneaker waves, especially this time of year! NEVER turn your back to the ocean and don’t climb on beach logs.
