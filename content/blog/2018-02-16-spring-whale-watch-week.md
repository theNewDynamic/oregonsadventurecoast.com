title: Spring Whale Watching Season is Coming!

  In just a few weeks, an estimated 18,000 migrating gray whales will begin
  their northbound journey to Alaska and visitors will have the chance see them
  as they pass the Oregon Coast. As they make their way back to the feeding
  grounds off the shores of Alaska, the whales tend to travel to stay closer to
  shore—within a half mile is not unusual. The peak travel time is in March, but
  migrating whales can be spotted off our coast well into the summer months.

Though the Oregon Coast offers many spectacular viewing spots, <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/2015/02/must-see-cape-arago-state-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cape Arago State Park</a>, located 15 miles southwest of Coos Bay, is perhaps one of our favorites. When you go, be sure to bring your binoculars and look deep into the Pacific from this fabulous whale watching perch pictured below.
