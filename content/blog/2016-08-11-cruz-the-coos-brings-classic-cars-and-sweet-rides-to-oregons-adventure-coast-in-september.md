September is just around the corner and everyone’s talking about <a href="http://cruzthecoos.com/" target="_blank">Cruz the Coos</a>, now presented by <a href="http://coosbaynorthbendrotary.org/" target="_blank">The Coos Bay-North Bend Rotary Club</a>!  The event is one of the premiere vintage car cruises and show ‘n shines on the Oregon coast and part of the very popular <a href="/2016/08/here-comes-the-fun-the-bay-area-fun-festival-that-is/" target="_blank">Bay Area Fun Festival</a>.

Plan a visit to Oregon’s South Coast the weekend of September 17, 2016 and check out the sweet rides and vintage cars during the “Show ‘n Shine” at <a href="http://www.themillcasino.com/" target="_blank">The Mill Casino</a> and watch them in action as they hit the streets of Downtown Coos Bay later in the day. It’s not just fun, it’s a glimpse into automotive history!

For decades, “Cruz the Coos” has been one of the banner events happening on Oregon’s South Coast, so we are thrilled this family-friendly occasion will be back again this year!

Of course, you can start the fun early by joining the fun at the Dance Party/Meet featuring Classic Hits by _Timberwolf_ in the Mill Casino Salmon Room (21 & older). It’s guaranteed to be an evening of great tunes and equally great times!

Here are some pics from previous years’ Cruz the Coos to start revving your engines!
