Wanna know a well-kept travel secret? Fall is undoubtedly one of the BEST times to visit the Oregon Coast! Yes, we all love summer, but many folks do not know that fall is also an optimal time to plan a getaway - whether it’s a week, a weekend, or a fun day trip. In fact, the autumn months are so lovely that many of our locals refer to fall as the Oregon Coast’s “Second Summer.” Here are 13 reasons you’ll want to visit **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** this fall!

**#1 Beautiful Weather.** During the autumn months, visitors can still find plenty of sunny days, along with average highs in the upper 60’s and sometimes low 70’s. You may also be surprised to discover that the ocean’s temperature is actually WARMER in the fall than in the summer, a weather phenomenon many visitors don’t know about.

**#2 Smaller Crowds.** Since the crowds are usually smaller during this time, it’s a great time to do some early holiday shopping in our [unique shops and antique stores](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/shopping/). There is usually very little (if any) wait time to get a table in your [favorite restaurants](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/), and little to no traffic on the road.

**#3 You Basically Have the Beaches to Yourself!** Smaller crowds = better beachcombing, picnicking, or tide pooling experiences in our state parks and beaches. Some of our favorite[ local beaches](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) include Bastendorff Beach, Cape Arago State Park, Horsfall Beach, Shore Acres State Park & Simpson Beach, and of course, Sunset Bay State Park.

**#4 Great Hotel Deals.** The price of hotel lodging tends to drop after Labor Day Weekend, why not take advantage? [Click here](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/) to find the best rates on hotel stays.

**#5-Fun Festivals and Gatherings.** The third weekend of September is always fun here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. The [Annual Bay Area Fun Festival](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-bay-area-fun-festival/) (September 17-18, 2022) features live entertainment, street vendors, unique wares, delicious food and drink, and a parade through downtown Coos Bay! This event is held in conjunction with the [Annual Cruz the Coos and Show ‘n Shine](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-cruz-the-coos/) (9/17-9/18) and [Prefontaine Memorial Run ](https://prefontainerun.com/)(9/18). [Octoberfish](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/octoberfish/) (October 1, 2022) happens annually on the first Saturday in October and is free to attend!! Come celebrate Coos culture, art, music, food, and activities at this family friendly event!

**#6- Fall Bounty at the Coos Bay Downtown Farmers Market.** The[ CBDA Farmers Market](https://coosbaydowntown.org/farmers-market/), a popular open-air Farmers Market hosted by Coos Bay Downtown Association, happens each Wednesday from 9am-2pm in the heart of downtown Coos Bay. This popular market has nearly 90 vendors throughout the season. It features fresh, locally grown produce, eggs, honey, meat, baked goods, soaps, candles, homemade jams, jellies, and unique creations handcrafted by local artisans.

**#7- The Dahlias at Shore Acres State Park.** The glorious year-round gardens of [Shore Acres State Park](http://shoreacres.net/) feature lush plants and flowers from all over the world, but the stunning dahlias in the fall often steal the show! Visitors will also enjoy discovering the many other unique flowers, plants, evergreen shrubs and trees (including the largest Monterey Pine in Oregon) in this beloved garden, as well as amazing vistas of the Pacific Ocean and wildlife viewing.

**#8 Fall is for Fishing!** On Oregon’s Adventure Coast, we like to say “there’s fish for every season”. Anglers flock to the Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston region year-round thanks to an endless choice of prime fishing spots to choose from - there are more than 30 lakes and rivers for freshwater fishing, as well as fantastic [bay and ocean fishing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay) options in Coos County alone!

**#9- Fantastic Bird Watching Conditions.** The relatively mild climate on Oregon’s Adventure Coast creates ideal conditions for migrating birds and waterfowl year-round, and autumn is no exception. [The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (South Slough NERR)](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx), a 5,000-acre natural area located in the Coos estuary, offers some of the best bird watching in the state!

**#10- Premier Hiking & Biking Opportunities.** Fall is a glorious time to explore the dozens of [hiking](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking/) and [biking trails](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/cycling/) that will take you through the forest, mountains and cities, or along rivers and coast.

Some of our more popular camping destinations include (in no particular order), Sunset Bay State Park Campground, Bastendorff Beach County Park, Spinreel Campground, Mill Casino Hotel & RV Park, Oceanside RV Park, and Horsfall Beach OHV Campground.
