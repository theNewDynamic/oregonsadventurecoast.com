Wanna know a well-kept travel secret? Fall is undoubtedly one of the BEST times to visit the Oregon Coast! Yes, we all love summer, but many folks do not know that fall is also an optimal time to plan a getaway - whether it’s a week, a weekend, or a fun day trip. In fact, the autumn months are so lovely that many of our locals refer to fall as the Oregon Coast’s “Second Summer.” Here are 13 reasons you’ll want to visit **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** this fall!

**\#1 Beautiful Weather.** During the autumn months, visitors can still find plenty of sunny days, along with average highs in the upper 60’s and sometimes low 70’s. You may also be surprised to discover that the ocean’s temperature is actually WARMER in the fall than in the summer, a weather phenomenon many visitors don’t know about.

**\#2 Smaller Crowds.** Since the crowds are usually smaller during this time, it’s a great time to do some early holiday shopping in our [unique shops and antique stores](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/shopping/). There is usually very little (if any) wait time to get a table in your [favorite restaurants](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/), and little to no traffic on the road.

**\#3 You Basically Have the Beaches to Yourself!** Smaller crowds = better beachcombing, picnicking, or tide pooling experiences in our state parks and beaches. Some of our favorite[local beaches](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) include Bastendorff Beach, Cape Arago State Park, Horsfall Beach, Shore Acres State Park & Simpson Beach, and of course, Sunset Bay State Park.
