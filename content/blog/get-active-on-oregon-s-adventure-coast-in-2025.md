Oregon’s Adventure Coast is a [runner’s paradise](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/running/), offering diverse terrains for every level, from ocean-view trails through coastal forests to uncrowded beaches and ancient sand dunes. Coos Bay adds a rich legacy as the birthplace of Steve Prefontaine, one of history’s greatest distance runners. It’s where Pre discovered his passion, honed his skills, and raced to greatness—a true testament to the inspiring energy of this remarkable region. Here are some ideas on how to incorporate running into 2025:

**Train for a race.** We’re home to some of the best races in the Pacific Northwest, including the Annual Prefontaine Memorial Run in September. **Here are just a few of the races coming up.**

* [Run Whiskey Run, 1.5 mile, 5 mile, or 10 mile trail run](https://southcoastrunningclub.org/run-whiskey-run/) - October 11, 2025

Each week, there’s a chance to join the locals for a midweek [Hump Day Run](https://southcoastrunningclub.org/wednesday/) on Wednesday evenings or an invigorating [Thursday morning run](https://southcoastrunningclub.org/thursday/).
