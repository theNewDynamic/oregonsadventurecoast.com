*These Winter Storm Images Taken on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston** Perfectly Capture the Raw Power and Magnificence of the Ocean*

"Breathtaking." "Spectacular." "Nature’s beauty at its finest." These are just a few of the comments visitors share after witnessing a winter storm on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston. Winter storm watching is a treasured seasonal tradition, attracting thousands of visitors each year who are captivated by the Pacific Ocean's raw power and striking beauty.

Storm watching is more about ocean conditions than the weather itself. The Pacific Ocean is famously unpredictable—calm and serene one day, wild and churning the next. When conditions are just right, massive swells up to 35 feet can create wave crashes towering over 300 feet against rugged cliffs along the Oregon Coast, and especially along the cliffs of [Shore Acres State Park](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/storm-watching/). These spectacular occurrences are often called high surf events.

If you haven’t witnessed the awe-inspiring power of winter storms on Oregon’s Adventure Coast for yourself, these video clips should give you an idea of the ocean’s incredible force:

**What’s a “High Surf” Warning?** The National Weather Service (NWS) will send a High Surf warning when a weather system off the coast is likely to come ashore and bring flooding, dangerous surf, and high winds. These conditions are usually optimal for [winter storm watching](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/storm-watching/) when Pacific storms cause ocean swells of 16 to 35 feet or higher, often leading to a magnificent show as they crash into our coastline's immovable and rugged cliffs.

**When Should I Plan a Trip to See a Winter Storm?** Unfortunately, nature does not plan that far ahead, and we only receive a few days’ notice from the NWS when a winter storm and high surf are imminent. We will post on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast) anytime we have a High Surf Advisory or Warning.

**Is Winter Storm Watching Dangerous?** It’s exciting to get close to the action, but it can become hazardous very quickly if you get too close or are not careful. There are designated areas on Oregon’s Adventure Coast where visitors are high above the water and can experience the storm at a distance. Follow these tips to stay safe!

&nbsp;

* **Watch From a Distance.** As alluring as the waves can be, <u>always </u>watch from a safe distance like Shore Acres State Park. Sneaker waves—unexpectedly large and powerful—can appear without warning along beaches and low-lying surf areas and can have deadly consequences. Stay at least 100 feet from the water’s edge, and **Never Turn Your Back on the Ocean**. Be sure to obey all warning signs and barricades. If you’re taking photos or selfies, do so from a safe distance!

&nbsp;

* **Avoid Walking on Logs, Jetties, and Cliff Edges.** Beach logs can quickly become dangerous during a sneaker wave, and jetties or cliff edges may be slippery and unstable in stormy weather. A sudden wave or gust of wind could cause a fall. Stay safe by sticking to designated viewpoints and trails. Better yet, stay off of beaches and jetties during winter storms as they can become hazardous due to dangerous surf conditions.

**When can I see Winter Storms?** Only Mother Nature can plan these wild winter storms, so the key is to keep an eye on the forecast! The best storm-watching conditions typically occur between November and March. Check local and extended forecasts on sites like the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/), [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/)and [Northwest Weather Network,](http://northwesternweather.net/) and pack your bags when swells of 20-30 feet are predicted. You can also follow our[Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast/) to find out when winter storms are coming.

Oregon’s Adventure Coast offers multiple vantage points for storm watchers and photographers alike, offering unmatched views of towering waves and moody skies. Check out these photographs taken at Shore Acres by local photographer, [Steven Micheal](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61569320854737).

*Please note: The people in these photos are safely positioned in designated viewing areas. Camera angles may make them appear closer to the waves than they actually are. For your safety, never leave designated areas for a better view—it's too dangerous and not worth the risk.*
