The Coos Art Museum will open its <a href="http://www.coosart.org/maritime-art-exhibit-2016-and-more/" target="_blank">23rd Annual Maritime Art Exhibition</a> in the first floor Maggie Karl Gallery this weekend! The juried exhibition displays maritime-themed artwork by major artists from across the United States. Seventy-six works by forty-four of the nation’s leading maritime artists are featured.

The works are in a variety of media including: oil, watercolor, acrylic, pastel, ink, ceramic, bronze, wood, colored pencil, and mixed media sculpture. The exhibition runs through September 24, 2016. It is sanctioned by <a href="http://americansocietyofmarineartists.com/" target="_blank">American Society of Marine Artists</a>, co-sponsored by the <a href="http://portofcoosbay.com/" target="_blank">Oregon International Port of Coos Bay</a>, and partially funded by a grant from the <a href="http://www.coquilletribalfund.org/" target="_blank">Coquille Tribal Community Fund</a>.

Coos Art Museum’s Annual Maritime Art Exhibition is the American Society of Marine Artists (ASMA) regional competition for the entire western United States. It is the oldest continuous Maritime art competition on the West Coast.

The ASMA jurors include: Donald Demers of Eliot Maine; Jeffrey Hull of Cannon Beach, Oregon; and Debra Huse of Costa Mesa, California. Works will be honored for Best in Show; Peoples’ Choice Award; Oregon International Port of Coos Bay Award; and the Coos Art Museum Board of Directors Award.

William A. Selden of Coos Bay is the featured maritime artist and his paintings will be highlighted in the adjacent Perkins Gallery during the exhibition. He received formal art education at the California Institute of Arts (Chouinard) and the Art Center College of Design. Selden is also a past winner of many awards from Annual Maritime Art Exhibitions. In 2011 he received “Best of Show” and in 2010 he received the “People’s Choice Award.”
