*Heading to the Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston this Winter? Here’s a List of Travel Essentials You’ll Want to Pack.*

If you’re thinking about a [winter getaway](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/ten-things-to-do-this-winter-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) on[Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/adventures/), you’re not alone. Winter is a beautiful season to travel to the Oregon Coast, so much s**o that we’re offering visitors** [**15% off lodging at participating properties**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/storm15/) **from January 1st, 2022 through February 28, 2022**!

[Travel Oregon’s Emily Forsha](http://traveloregon.com/author/eforsha/) says winter is her favorite season on the Oregon Coast. “You might find yourself cozying up by a fireplace, watching angry waves crash during a spectacular storm; or you may find yourself on an uncrowded beach on a clear, sunny day that ends with a sunset over a beach bonfire,” she writes in her post,[*The Oregon Coast, A Winter Odyssey*](http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/oregon-stories/the-oregon-coast-a-winter-odyssey/%20).

Winter is sometimes referred to as our “secret season” or “second summer” because it is not always cold and rainy. Average temperatures range from the high 30s to the high 40s from December through February, but it’s not uncommon for coastal residents and visitors to be treated to spectacular balmy days of sunshine and warmer temperatures mimicking summer weather. The key to enjoying your adventure is to pack smart and plan ahead. Here’s a packing list of Oregon Coast travel essentials to help you get the most out of your winter vacation!

**What to Wear**

The vibe on Oregon’s Adventure Coast is laid back and casual. There’s rarely a need for formalwear of any kind. Jeans, t-shirts and comfortable shoes are the standard look around here. November, December and January are the wettest months, but a jacket with a hood is a year-round staple. And while our area is temperate year-round, there are daily fluctuations. Layered clothing allows you to adjust for changes in temperature accordingly. Your packing list might look something like this:

* A light, waterproof jacket
* Hiking boots (waterproof ones are the best)
* A warm hat
* Jeans or long pants
* Short sleeve and/or long sleeve t-shirts
* Pull over sweatshirts and sweaters
* Comfortable shoes - you’ll probably do a lot of walking
* Multiple pairs of warm socks
* Gloves
* A combination of shorts and long pants will give you some options for daytime adventures

**What Else to Bring**

* **Face mask**\- Face coverings are mandatory for all when inside a public space
* **Binoculars** for viewing wildlife and marine mammals (like migrating gray whales in December and January)
* **Gear for specific activities** you plan to do: i.e. waders for fishing or a wetsuit for surfing
* **Waterproof Bag** and/or other sealable bag to hold your electronics and valuables
* A bag to collect shells, rocks, small pieces of driftwood – or trash, if that is your choice (the tide deposits small pieces of plastic debris that is harmful for birds and ocean critters)
* Polarized Sunglasses
* Reusable Water Bottle
* Camera
* Cash- some locations may charge a fee for access
* Your Oregon State Park Annual Pass (if you have one)
* Cooler to store water, snacks and meals-on-the-go
* A printed map (if cell service is limited in some outdoor areas).

* [Tide Schedule](https://www.tideschart.com/United-States/Oregon/Coos-County/Coos-Bay/) & Beach Safety Awareness
* Sunscreen- Even on overcast days, you can get a sunburn!
* Fishing License If you plan to fish, go crabbing and/or clamming, an Oregon fishing and/or shellfishing license is required for those age 12 years or older. We recommend stopping by Bi-Mart or Walmart for a license, though you can also find them in some bait shops and sporting goods stores on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.
