## Outdoor Festival Celebrating Native American and Coquille Tribal Culture to Take Place at The Mill Casino Hotel & RV Park September 11-12, 2021

“Our ancestors flourished among the forests, rivers, meadows and beaches of southwestern Oregon. The land and water offered endless life-sustaining resources, and our people adapted ingeniously to this waterside paradise.” **- Coquille Indian Tribe**

Much like the Salmon return upstream, the [Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration](https://www.themillcasino.com/entertainment/17th-annual-mill-luck-salmon-celebration/2021-09-12/) returns to the Mill Casino in North Bend after a hiatus in 2020 due to the COVID shutdown.

The outdoor festival celebrates the heritage, culture and traditions of the [Coquille Indian Tribe](https://www.coquilletribe.org/) and other Pacific Northwest Tribes, with residents and visitors to Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston. Throughout the weekend, festival attendees can enjoy free daily performances by Native American storytellers, drummers, flutists and dancers, a marketplace offering traditional wares and foods, a bay-front canoe exhibit and races, traditional games and activities for children, plus various cultural demonstrations and educational exhibits for the whole family. The traditional salmon bake meal, a ticketed event, will be served from 11 AM – 5 PM Saturday and 11 AM – 4 PM Sunday.

The Coquille Indian Tribe, pronounced “ko-kwel”, has a rich culture and history dating back thousands of years as a proud nation that flourished in Oregon’s southwest corner. Today, approximately 1,100 members control about 10,000 acres of their ancestral homeland as sustainable forest. The Coquilles invest in the education and well-being of their members and proudly uphold the “potlatch” tradition of sharing with the surrounding community. To date, the Coquille Tribal Community Fund has given millions of dollars to local non-profit organizations to strengthen the community.

Tickets will be available in Ko-Kwel Gifts and include a commemorative Salmon Celebration tee shirt (while supplies last) starting August 10, 2021.
