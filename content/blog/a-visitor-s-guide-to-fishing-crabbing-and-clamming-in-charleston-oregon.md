Fishing is part of everyday life in Charleston, and there are plenty of ways for visitors to join the fun. You can try your luck from public docks, launch your own boat, rent a kayak, or head out with a [local charter](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tour-guides-and-charters/). There is no need to bring gear with you; [local rental and outfitting shops](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/where-to-gear-up-for-adventure-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) have what you need and can point you in the right direction.

Here are a few charter companies that run offshore trips out of Charleston Marina, offering seasonal fishing opportunities and earning high marks from both visitors and locals. *Please note that services are weather-dependent, and calling ahead is recommended.*

Here are a few tips to keep in mind as you plan a fishing adventure in Charleston:

* **What you can catch changes with the season.** Winter typically brings steelhead, surf perch, and rockfish, along with crabbing and clamming, while spring shifts to salmon, surf perch, and bass. Species like lingcod, halibut, and tuna are available at different times of year, depending on conditions and regulations. We recommend downloading our [list of local fishing resources](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/fishing-rackcard.pdf) to help you plan your trip.
* **An** [Oregon fishing license](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing-license-requirements/) **is required unless it's a Free Fishing Day.** Daily, multi-day, and annual licenses are available at sporting goods stores and online through the[Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife](https://odfw.huntfishoregon.com/login). Bait shops are also a good place to get your fishing license as well as check current conditions and get local tips. Find a list of vendors [here](https://myodfw.com/articles/where-find-odfw-license-agentsvendors) *(scroll to Coos Bay & North Bend for local vendors)*.
* **Weather and tides affect fishing conditions,** especially during the winter months, so checking forecasts and tide tables ahead of time is recommended. Pick up your local Tide Table at all [three local Visitor Center locations](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/).

### **Crabbing in Charleston, Oregon**

![Three people standing on a dock at Charleston Marina hold up freshly caught Dungeness crabs beside a crab pot filled with traps and rope, with fishing boats and a working marina visible in the background on a clear day.](/img/crabfeed-1976-1.jpg)

Crabbing is another favorite activity on Oregon's Adventure Coast, and Charleston is one of the easiest places to try it. Many locals swear by the months with an R (January through March) when Dungeness crab, a staple of the Oregon Coast diet, are most commonly caught.

Visitors are often surprised to learn how accessible crabbing is. You don't need special skills or experience, nor do you need a boat or a lot of money to give crabbing a try in Charleston. Public docks at Charleston Marina provide direct access, offering families and first-time crabbers a relaxing way to spend a few hours and experience daily life on the docks. The [Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife](https://myodfw.com/articles/how-crab) is a wonderful resource for anyone interested in crabbing on the Oregon Coast, whether it’s your first time or your thirtieth. Be sure to take a look at their “[How to Crab](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/docs/CrabbingFlyer.pdf)” flyer for helpful tips and important details before you head out. Some key tips to remember:

* **A shellfish license is required for crabbing**, and anyone age 12 and older must have one.
* **Check current regulations and limits** through the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife before heading out.
* **Local shops and marina markets are great resources** for tips on timing, setup, and current conditions.
* **Basic equipment,** including a crab measuring tool, pots or rings, bait, gloves, and a cooler, can be [purchased or rented at local bait and tackle shops](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/equipment-rent-and-buy/), so there's no need to bring gear with you.

### **Clamming on Oregon's Adventure Coast**

![A close-up of a hand holding a large clam freshly dug from wet sand at low tide, with muddy flats, scattered shells, and people in boots clamming in the background along the Oregon Coast.](/img/clamming-oregon-s-adventure-coast.jpg)

Clamming is an easy way to spend time outdoors on Oregon's Adventure Coast and can be harvested year-round, though spring, summer, and fall typically offer the most ideal conditions. Clamming is an easy, family-friendly way to take part in a long-standing Oregon Coast tradition, and it’s [accessible to visitors of all ages and experience levels](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/a-first-timer-s-guide-to-clamming-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) since it requires little gear and no special skills.

Charleston is a perfect option for first-time clammers as it has [well-known spots](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/clamming-map-charleston-06-20.pdf), including Charleston Triangle and Charleston Flat, where broad tide flats support species such as gaper, cockle, littleneck, softshell, and butter clams. Point Adams, located at the end of Boat Basin Road in Charleston, is another popular area, especially for cockle clams during low tide.[<u>Maps of local clamming areas</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/clamming-map-charleston-06-20.pdf) are available and can help visitors plan their outing around tides and access points. For the best experience, follow these tips:

* **Check the tides.** Always go at low tide for a successful outing. Zero and minus tides are even better because they expose large areas of mudflat, providing the best access. Tide tables are available online, at local retailers, and at [Visitor Information Centers in Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/).
* **Get a shellfish license (it’s required for clamming).** Anyone age 12 and older must have a valid Oregon shellfish license. Licenses can be purchased [online through the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife](https://myodfw.com/articles/how-buy-license-or-tag) or at [local retailers such as sporting goods stores and tackle shops](https://myodfw.com/articles/find-odfw-licensed-agents-or-vendors).
* **Check current regulations and health advisories before harvesting shellfish**. Temporary closures and safety updates are posted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Oregon Health Authority.
* **There are** [local bait-and-tackle shops that will rent clamming tools](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/equipment-rent-and-buy/) \*\* \*\* and can provide guidance on timing and locations. Basic equipment includes a bucket or mesh bag, a shovel, rake, or clam gun, waterproof boots (trust us on that one), and waterproof gloves. Consider bringing a cooler, access to fresh water for rinsing, towels, and a tide chart.
