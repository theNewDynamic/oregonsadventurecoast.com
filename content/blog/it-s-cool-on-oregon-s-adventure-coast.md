### Spread Out, Beat the Heat and Stay Cool on Oregon’s Adventure Coast

Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston is known for being cool, literally. Yes, there are scores of “cool” [social-distance-friendly activities](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/five-fun-ways-to-social-distance-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) the whole family can enjoy, but with an average summertime temperature of mid-high 60s, our region offers a blissful escape from scorching hot temperatures you might be experiencing more inland during this time of year.

We’re so cool, that we’re giving away a “[Cool at the Coast](https://www.kezi.com/content/contests/571605781.html#//)” prize package that includes two nights at The Best Western Holiday Hotel, a gift certificate for [Wildflour Cafe](https://www.wildflour-catering.com/)' and Meal & Bowling vouchers from [North Bend Lanes ](https://northbendlanes.com/)**_(hurry, you must enter by August 9, 2020!!)_**.

You can relax knowing that Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston offers plenty of space to spread out and adventures to invigorate. Here are a few ideas on how to keep your cool AND stay safe this summer.

### [Combine the Cape Arago Highway Loop & Charleston to Bandon Tour Route for the Ultimate Oregon Coast Road Trip](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/featured-road-trip-cape-arago-highway-charleston-to-bandon-tour-route/)

This 41-mile route features everything you could hope to see along the Oregon Coast — iconic views of the Pacific ocean, marine life, sea lions and seabirds, untouched beaches, secret coves, six state parks, two National Wildlife Refuges and America’s first National Estuarine Research Reserve.

### [Get “Beachy” at Bastendorff Beach](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2017-08-29-spotlight-on-bastendorff-beach/)

We love all of our beautiful, undeveloped beaches here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. But [Bastendorff Beach](http://www.co.coos.or.us/Departments/CoosCountyParks/Bastendorff.aspx), about two miles west of Charleston, seems to be a fan favorite. It’s never crowded and makes you feel as if you’ve entered a different world, even though you’re only minutes from town. The beach is ideal for picnicking, walking/jogging or just spending a relaxing day perched on a beach chair gazing at the sea. It’s a favorite among surfers, kiters, campers, beachcombers and locals and tourists alike. Visitors going to the beach should be aware of [coastal safety hazards](http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/PARKS/beach_tips.shtml) with the potential danger of [undertows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertow_(wave_action)), [sneaker waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneaker_wave) and [rolling logs](http://www.co.coos.or.us/Portals/0/Parks/BriefParkRules.pdf).

### [Surf On!](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation/)
