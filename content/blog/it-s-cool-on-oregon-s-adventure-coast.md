### Spread Out, Beat the Heat and Stay Cool on Oregon’s Adventure Coast

Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston is known for being cool, literally. Yes, there are scores of “cool” [social-distance-friendly activities](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/five-fun-ways-to-social-distance-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) the whole family can enjoy, but with an average summertime temperature of mid-high 60s, our region offers a blissful escape from scorching hot temperatures you might be experiencing more inland during this time of year.

We’re so cool, that we’re giving away a “Cool at the Coast” prize package that includes two nights at The Best Western Holiday Hotel, a gift certificate for [Wildflour Cafe](https://www.wildflour-catering.com/)' and Meal & Bowling vouchers from [North Bend Lanes ](https://northbendlanes.com/)**_._**

You can relax knowing that Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston offers plenty of space to spread out and adventures to invigorate. Here are a few ideas on how to keep your cool AND stay safe this summer.

### [Combine the Cape Arago Highway Loop & Charleston to Bandon Tour Route for the Ultimate Oregon Coast Road Trip](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/featured-road-trip-cape-arago-highway-charleston-to-bandon-tour-route/)

This 41-mile route features everything you could hope to see along the Oregon Coast — iconic views of the Pacific ocean, marine life, sea lions and seabirds, untouched beaches, secret coves, six state parks, two National Wildlife Refuges and America’s first National Estuarine Research Reserve.

### [Get “Beachy” at Bastendorff Beach](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2017-08-29-spotlight-on-bastendorff-beach/)

We love all of our beautiful, undeveloped beaches here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. But [Bastendorff Beach](http://www.co.coos.or.us/Departments/CoosCountyParks/Bastendorff.aspx), about two miles west of Charleston, seems to be a fan favorite. It’s never crowded and makes you feel as if you’ve entered a different world, even though you’re only minutes from town. The beach is ideal for picnicking, walking/jogging or just spending a relaxing day perched on a beach chair gazing at the sea. It’s a favorite among surfers, kiters, campers, beachcombers and locals and tourists alike. Visitors going to the beach should be aware of [coastal safety hazards](http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/PARKS/beach_tips.shtml) with the potential danger of [undertows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertow_(wave_action)), [sneaker waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneaker_wave) and [rolling logs](http://www.co.coos.or.us/Portals/0/Parks/BriefParkRules.pdf).

### [Surf On!](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation/)

There’s a reason why surfers love Oregon's Adventure Coast! We could explain, but we’d rather show you in this 2018 video our friend Rick Dancer shared when he experienced Surfing Oregon's Adventure Coast style!
