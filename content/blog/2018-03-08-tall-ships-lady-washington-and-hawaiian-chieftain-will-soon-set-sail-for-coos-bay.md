<h3>About the Lady Washington</h3>

Built in 1989, the wooden-hulled Lady Washington is the official ship of Washington state. The vessel is a full-scale replica of the original Lady Washington that fought in the Revolutionary War and has appeared in several motion pictures and television shows, including <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</em>, <em>Star Trek: Generations</em>, <em>Once Upon A Time</em>, and <em>Revolution</em>. The Lady Washington travels to various portside cities delivering education programs to the public K-12 students in public schools, private schools, and in home-school groups.
