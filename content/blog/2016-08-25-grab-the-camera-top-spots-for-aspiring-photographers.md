Looking to update your portfolio and beef up your Instagram? Perhaps you’re just looking for some stunning scenery to capture in some timeless shots. No matter your goal and experience level, the Coos Bay area has the perfect backdrop for a planned and impromptu photo-sessions.

Sure, it would take us all day to list out every breathtaking landscape you can find in Coos Bay/North-Bend/Charleston, but here are some of our favorites for you to explore!

### 1. Golden and Silver Falls

A beautiful nature park, high vantage points, and waterfalls! Golden and Silver falls is an absolute must for anyone looking to pull of some perfect panorama pictures.

### 2. Cape Arago State Park

If you’re in Coos Bay and looking to have a photo session then you have to visit a state park, and if you’re planning to visit a state park then Cape Arago is one of our favorites. Beachside paths, nature trails, and vibrant contrasting colors make for a terrific subject.

### 3. Empire Dock

When you have sunsets like ours, sometimes you just have to get out on the water. If you’re looking to bring out something a bit more poetic in your shots, be sure to visit Empire Dock in the golden hour. You won’t regret it.

### 4. Mingus Park

Ah, Mingus Park, a natural bend of beauty and color. You could spend the entire day photographing its sights and sites (and many have).

### 5. Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area

Look at that. You can’t photograph landscapes in Oregon’s Adventure Coast and leave out the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Its bounty of silky smooth sand dunes look like something out of a science-fiction film. You can also get some good action shots of local <a href="/2016/07/sand-duning-or-sandboarding-either-way-its-time-to-ride-the-oregon-dunes/" target="_blank">dune-boarders and sand-duners!</a>

### 6. Shore Acres State Park

Last, but as you can see in no ways least, is Shore Acres State Park. Hiking trails, extensive park, and even wildlife viewing opportunities (did somebody say whales and sea lions?) await photographers at Shore Acres. Bring the wide angle lens and don’t forget some sunscreen!
