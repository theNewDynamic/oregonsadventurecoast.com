In a year when so much bad has happened, we still have much to be thankful for. In honor of the holiday season, here are just a few things that we’re most grateful for on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston.

We are grateful for the many businesses and local residents who are coming together to light up our community for “[Christmas at the Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/christmas-2020-is-not-canceled...introducing-christmas-at-the-coast/)”. Though we will miss our regular holiday events like the Shore Acres Holiday Lights display this year, we’re going to make the best of it and offer something special for visitors and residents to safely enjoy!

We are grateful for the staff who work in [our local hotels](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/how-hotels-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast-are-keeping-guests-safe/) and have done so much to keep visitors safe.

We are grateful for our amazing[ local restaurant community](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/how-oregon-s-adventure-coast-restaurants-stepped-up-during-covid-19-crisis/) that stepped up in big ways to help others during this difficult time. Many local restaurants provided free meals for children who may not have eaten otherwise when school breakfasts and lunches were paused due to the shutdown last spring. [7 Devils Brewing Co.](https://www.7devilsbrewery.com/store/p56/Soup_for_our_local_homeless_population-DONATE_HERE.html#/) has been making soup for the homeless with donations from the community. And when our restaurants needed help, our community stepped up and supported them by [ordering take out and gift cards](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2757874947622484).

We’re grateful for the endless natural beauty that the Oregon coast gives us whether it’s watching waves crash over the Pacific, riding along the majestic Oregon Dunes or going for a hike in one of our many glorious state parks.

We are grateful for the bountiful seafood that can be found throughout Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area, especially steelhead, salmon, crab and clams.

We are especially grateful for the special visitors who came here to seek refuge from their day-to-day lives and recharge. We’re so appreciative that they respected our community health guidelines and followed the necessary protocols to keep themselves and our community safe.

We could go on, but we’ll let some of the Coos Bay Visitor Center staff share what they are most grateful for.

> **Cheryl Crockett:** “Even though I complain a lot about the current situation, I have many things to be thankful for. A roof over my head, a warm safe place to live and work, 5 good kids and 10 amazing grandkids. We should all be counting our blessings for the health we have, families and friends.”
>
> **Janice Langlinais:** “I am so thankful for this beautiful part of the Oregon Coast that feeds my soul daily. Walking through the forest to the cliffs, hearing the roar of the ocean and the barking of the seals, and feeling the sand beneath my feet - these are a few of my favorite things! I am truly blessed to be able to do these things anytime just a few minutes from my front door. As 2020 winds down, I am grateful for the lessons learned, the new solutions discovered, and the friendships made despite the situation we all have found ourselves in this year.”

> **Allison C. Richards: “**I’m thankful for our community. Time and time again, I have seen this community wrap its arms around those in need, their fellow business owners and individuals alike. This year has been especially trying for so many. We are blessed to live in a place where the people are dedicated to making it better for everyone.”
