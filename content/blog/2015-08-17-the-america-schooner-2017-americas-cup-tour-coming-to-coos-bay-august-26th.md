  Sailing fans of all ages are in for a treat!

  The 1851 replica schooner, America, will be visiting The Port of Coos Bay and the Coos Bay Yacht Club later this month as part of the 2017 America’s Cup Tour. Troy Sears, owner and skipper of America, says “This opportunity is about more than engaging the yachting community in discussions about the current state of America’s Cup racing. It’s also about generating greater interest and awareness among today’s youth. We’re looking forward to welcoming young minds aboard America to explore the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM disciplines) that have always been an integral part of America’s Cup racing.”

**IN THE BEGINNING**

In 1851 a radical looking schooner ghosted out of the afternoon mist and swiftly sailed past the Royal Yacht stationed in the Solent, between the Isle of Wight and the south coast of England, on an afternoon when Queen Victoria was watching a sailing race.

As the schooner, named America, passed the Royal Yacht in first position, and saluted by dipping its ensign three times, Queen Victoria asked one of her attendants to tell her who was in second place.

”Your Majesty, there is no second,” came the reply. That phrase, just four words, is still the best description of the America’s Cup, and how it represents the singular pursuit of excellence.

Troy Sears will take the modern replica of the world’s most famous racing yacht, America, to sailing communities in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. This will give sailing fans of all ages a chance to sail back in time aboard a painstaking replica of the original “America,” which in 1851 stunned the world by winning the legendary sailing race around the Isle of Wight and won the trophy that now bears her name, the America’s Cup!

The tour launched in July 2015 out of San Diego, California, and the yacht America will embark on a North American voyage, serving as an official ambassador of the America’s Cup.
