Due to popular demand, The **Coos Bay-North Bend-Charleston Visitor & Convention Bureau**, (aka **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**) has announced its "Claw-some" Crab Cake Bake-Off is back for 2024! The annual baking competition invites amateur and professional bakers ages 10 and up to design and bake a Dungeness crab-themed cake (not a CRAB dish but a bakery item) and document the process and the finished product with photos and video for a chance to win a complimentary two-night stay in the region, complete with lodging, activities and dining options.

Coos Bay-North Bend-Charleston Visitor and Convention Bureau Executive Director, Janice Langlinais says the organization chose the Dungeness crab theme for the cake baking competition because it is a reflection of Oregon's maritime heritage and a vital part of the local economy. “The historical significance of Dungeness crab with Oregon's fishing industry cannot be underscored enough,” she says. “There is a reason why this iconic shellfish is the symbol of Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston.Plus, it’s really fun.”

There will be four categories for contestants to choose from for this year’s competition:

* **Kids** ages 10-17 (*requires Parent/Guardian approval*)
* **Amateur Adults** (*ages 18 and up*)
* **Professional Adults** *(bakers ages 18 and up* *who are working professionally in a bakery, restaurant, school or other facility)*
* **Professional In Training** *(Culinary students currently training at an accredited culinary school or other culinary training program)*

Contestants will have until June 30, 2024 to submit their photos/videos and list of ingredients to Oregon’s Adventure Coast. Each submission will be judged by its creativity, ability to incorporate the theme, crab imagery and coastal style. Physical cakes will not be accepted and all entries must include a video of someone cutting and taking a bite of the cake to ensure it is an edible item. Please be sure to include a video demonstrating cutting and eating a piece of cake.

For inspiration and a list of last year’s winners, be sure to read our post, [And the Winners of the 2023 "Claw-some" Crab Cake Bake-Off Are.....](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/and-the-winners-of-the-2023-claw-some-crab-cake-bake-off-are/)

## Here's what else you need to know:

* This is a **cake-baking competition**, so we are looking for bakery items, NOT a crab dish. These could be cupcakes, as well as any size cake.

  &nbsp;

* The contest is free to enter and can be done from your home or work kitchen.

  &nbsp;

* Physical cakes will not be submitted for this contest.

  &nbsp;

* Bakers must submit a short video and photos of their cake-making process, as well as the finished product. The cake must be cut on camera and someone in the video must take a bite to ensure the cake is an edible item.

  &nbsp;

* Bakers will also need to submit a brief description of the ingredients and inspiration. We encourage you to express yourself - whatever this concept means to you is fine, as long as you explain it. It does not have to be an exact depiction of a crab. Don’t forget to give your cake a catchy name to make it stand out!

  &nbsp;

* Presentation is one of the most critical factors in the competition. Be creative with your presentation and find unique ways to present your cake.

  &nbsp;

* Contestants may work individually or with a team. (Prizes will be awarded to 1 member per team only, NOT each team member)

  &nbsp;

* Winners will be announced in July 2024, and prizes will be distributed shortly thereafter. Winners will have one year in which to take their trip to Oregon’s Adventure Coast. *Travel to and from the Coos Bay North Bend, Charleston area is not included in the prize.*
