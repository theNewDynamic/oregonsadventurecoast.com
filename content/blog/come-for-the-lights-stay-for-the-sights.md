If you’re among those traveling from out-of-town to see the holiday lights this year, we hope you’ll stick around and experience more of what Oregon’s Adventure Coast has to offer!  There’s a reason why our region is known as the place “Where the Soul Meets the Sea”.  Here are some tips to help you enjoy the very best of Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston, Oregon during your visit this holiday season.

#### #1 Learn Something New

The 6,000-square-foot [Charleston Marine Life Center](http://www.charlestonmarinelifecenter.com/),, located on the campus of [ UO’s Institute of Marine Biology](https://oimb.uoregon.edu/) features permanent exhibits including a Marine Ecosystem Gallery, an Underwater Oregon Gallery (where after just a few minutes exploring, you’re likely to see a multitude of marine life you may have never known existed) and an Oregon Fisheries Gallery (an open-air deck where visitors can see fishing vessels coming and going from the harbor). Visit t [oimb.uoregon.edu](https://oimb.uoregon.edu/)for more info.

We also recommend spending a day at the [South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve Interpretive Center](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/NATRES/pages/rs_faqcoastal.aspx#What_is_a_Research_Reserve_) learning about our local culture, history and natural resources. There are miles of beautiful hiking trails and waterways to explore in addition to classes/workshops for all ages.

#### #3 Explore the Sights on Cape Arago Highway

On a nice day, spend some time exploring the beaches and state parks along the Cape Arago Highway.

We recommend grabbing your binoculars and taking some time to explore the Simpson Reef and nearby Shell Island to view and listen to the seals and sea lions.  Be sure to look for sea lions, harbor seals, and occasional elephant seals in the viewing area overlooking Shell Island.
