## It’s Time To Start Dreaming for the Year Ahead!

Need a vacation? You are not alone! According to data prepared for the U.S. Travel Association by the research firm Destination Analysts, more than six in 10 Americans (63%) report they “desperately” need a vacation after the trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also found nearly 8 in 10 (77%) American workers say they are extremely or very happy while on vacation and many indicate this has a positive impact to their health and well being.

Yet, survey findings have continuously shown that vacation days are not being used, negatively affecting health, relationships and companies. American workers say that **33%** of their paid vacation days went unused last year!

If vacations have so many positive benefits, why aren’t more people taking them? According to travel experts, one of the causes of this phenomenon is insufficient planning. The [U.S. Travel Association](https://www.ustravel.org/) says Americans are more likely to use all their paid time off when they plan their vacation days for the whole year at the beginning of the year.

That is why the organization has launched a [National Plan for Vacation Day](https://www.ustravel.org/events/national-plan-vacation-day) (NPVD), celebrated on the last Tuesday of January, each year. The purpose of this day is to highlight the importance of taking time off to travel—both for our personal health and wellbeing and for the economic prosperity of our nation. If you want to take a vacation in 2021, NPVD will be celebrated on Tuesday January 26th but you can start planning your vacation at any time.

So, if you want to be happier with your job, health and wellbeing, it’s time to start dreaming and begin planning your next adventure. Yes, the pandemic has wreaked havoc on travel plans, but if you are one of the six in 10 American travelers (59%) who say they miss traveling (Destination Analysts, Coronavirus Travel Sentiment Index Report, 1/18), take heart, there is hope on the horizon!
