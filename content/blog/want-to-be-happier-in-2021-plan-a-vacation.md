Need a vacation? You are not alone! After two years of living through the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans are feeling burned out and ready for a change of scenery. However, Americans are still not using all of their vacation days. American workers left an average of more than four days or 29% of their paid time off on the table last year, but the majority of Americans (64%) say they desperately need a vacation.

Why aren’t more people taking vacations? According to travel experts, one of the causes of this phenomenon is insufficient planning. The [U.S. Travel Association](https://www.ustravel.org/) says Americans are more likely to use all their paid time off when they plan their vacation days for the whole year at the beginning of the year.

That is why the organization has launched a [National Plan for Vacation Day](https://www.ustravel.org/events/national-plan-vacation-day) (NPVD), celebrated on the last Tuesday of January, each year. The purpose of this day is to highlight the importance of taking time off to travel—both for our personal health and wellbeing and for the economic prosperity of our nation. If you want to take a vacation in 2022, NPVD will be celebrated on Tuesday January 25th but you can start planning your vacation at any time.

**Vacations by the numbers:**

* More than two-thirds (68%) of American workers feel at least moderately burned out and 13% are extremely burned out
* More than nine in 10 (91%) Americans say it is important to use their paid time off to travel
* Nearly eight in 10 (79%) believe vacations are important to their overall health and well-being
* Nearly six in 10 (59%) agree that travel is more important than ever and 61% plan to make travel a top budget priority in 2022

**The importance of vacation planning:**

* Americans who plan out their time off take more time off to travel—but one-quarter (24%) of American households don’t do this simple step. As a result, they lose or have to forfeit these days
* Planners prioritize traveling with their paid time off, a trend that is expected to continue to rise in 2022 where 53% of planners anticipate traveling more than previous years versus 27% of non-planners
* People who plan their vacations tend to travel more than non-planners. More than half (56%) of Americans who typically planned their time off took an overnight vacation in 2021 compared to 33% of non-planners
* Anticipating and planning travel makes Americans happy. Close to three-quarters (74%) of planners reported being extremely or very happy anticipating and planning vacations in the next year versus just four in 10 of non-planners
* Avoiding burnout is an even greater motivator to book a trip for non-planners than planners—62% of non-planners rated avoiding burnout as a top motivator compared to 53% of planners
