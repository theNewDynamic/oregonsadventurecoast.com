This natural treasure features hiking trails, open water channels, tidal and freshwater wetlands, riparian areas, and forested uplands as well as an Interpretive Center.

**\#2 Have a Beach Day.** Your visit to Oregon's Adventure Coast would not be complete without a trip to one of our[beautiful, undeveloped beaches](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/)! Pack a picnic and spend a few hours on a local beach like Horsfall Beach, Bastendorff Beach, Sunset Bay State Park, Seven Devils State Recreation Site, Whiskey Run Beach, and more.

***\*\*Your safety is paramount when visiting the Oregon Coast. Sneaker waves, undertows, and drifting logs can pose unexpected dangers, so always stay aware and never turn your back on the ocean.\*\****

**\#3 Explore Cape Arago Beach Loop**. This scenic 8-mile stretch along the Cape Arago Highway (Oregon Route 540), known as the[Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/), is one of the most beautiful drives along Oregon's Adventure Coast. Visitors can explore all three of our state parks[<u>: Sunset Bay State Park</u>](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=70),[<u> Shore Acres State Park</u>](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/shore-acres-state-park/) (*note that a $10 parking fee applies*), and[Cape Arago State Park](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;amp;parkId=66). Hike the [Sunset Bay to Cape Arago Trail](https://shoreacres.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Trail-Map-Card-2016-web.pdf), a 6.5-mile round-trip loop or take a shorter out-and-back segment between the three state parks, along beautiful cliffs and down to hidden beaches.

Be sure to swing by the Shell Island Interpretive Stop, where you can get a great view of the seals and sea lions on[Simpson Reef and Shell Island](https://shoreacres.net/about-us/simpson-reef-and-shell-island/), part of the[Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/oregon_islands/).[Download our Charleston to Bandon Scenic Tour Driving Map](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/charleston-to-bandon-map.pdf) to help you on your route and choose your own experience.

A hike through lush coastal forests to[Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/exploring-golden-and-silver-falls-a-guide-to-hiking-this-natural-wonder-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) (not to be confused with Silver Falls State Park outside of Salem, OR) is not only a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, but it is also completely free!

**\#5 Explore the mysterious Oregon Dunes via the John Dellenback Trail.** Everyone should see the [Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/untamed-dunes/) at least once, but contrary to popular belief, you don't have to rent or own expensive equipment to do so. You can explore the vast expanse of the Oregon Dunes by bike or on foot if you know where to go. As the only non-motorized portion of the Oregon Dunes, the[John Dellenback Dunes Trail](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/John_Dellenback_Dunes_Loop_Hike) in Lakeside, OR, is a great place to experience the beauty of the dunes without the noise and for a fraction of the price (just a $5 day-use fee per vehicle, unless you have a Northwest Forest Pass).
