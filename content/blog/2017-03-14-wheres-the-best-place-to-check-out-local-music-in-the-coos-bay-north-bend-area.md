  hosts a fantastic selection of fun annual festivals featuring a range of musical
  genres (i.e. Oregon Coast Music Festival, Music on the Bay, BBQ, Blues and Brews
  by the Bay and many more), so we’re happy to see that our local music scene continues

Oregon's Adventure Coast already has a thriving restaurant and arts scene, so it's no wonder that our music culture is also growing.

The Coos Bay\~North Bend\~Charleston area already hosts a fantastic selection of fantastic annual festivals featuring a range of musical genres like the [South Coast Clambake Music Festival ](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/32nd-south-coast-clambake-music-festival/) (coming up March 13th, 2020!), the [Oregon Coast Music Festival](https://www.oregoncoastmusic.org/calendar-events/) (July), and a series of free concerts that take places throughout the summer in various destinations.

Our area also boasts multiple entertainment venues like [The Liberty Theatre ](http://thelibertytheatre.org/)(home of Little Theatre by the Bay), the beautifully restored historic [Egyptian Theatre ](https://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/)where visitors can frequently find great local music and entertainment options.

But it's inside our rustic beloved local pub where one can find a treasure trove of hidden musical gems! If you are looking for hipster listening rooms or glitzy pop venues, you’re just not going to find it here. However, if you are seeking a down-to-earth Oregon Coast vibe, we have some recommendations for you. Here is what our locals say are the best local places to support up and coming bands and musicians.
