The renowned American poet Maya Angelou once said, "I have great respect for the past. If you don't know where you've come from, you don't know where you're going." This sentiment rings especially true for **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, a region steeped in indigenous history, maritime heritage, natural beauty, and a resilient community spirit. In downtown Coos Bay, historic buildings stand alongside a diverse array of restaurants, unique shops, museums, and more.

In 2024, Coos Bay celebrates its 150th anniversary. Originally known as Marshfield, the city was incorporated on October 24, 1874, named after founder J.C. Tolman's Massachusetts hometown. Its history, however, extends far beyond this date, encompassing thousands of years of indigenous habitation by the [Coquille Indian Tribe](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tribal-heritage-coquilles/), [Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Siuslaw and Lower Umpqua Indians](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tribal-heritage-confederated/), and the [Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians](https://ctsi.nsn.us/). In 1944, residents voted to rename the city Coos Bay, honoring its prominent geographic feature, the deep-water bay for which is shares a name. In 1964, the nearby city of Empire merged with Coos Bay, a welcome addition due to its strategic location for shipping and timber. In 1983, the city further expanded by merging with the city of Eastside, solidifying its status as the largest city on the Oregon Coast. Here are some resources and ideas to help you celebrate Coos Bay's 150th anniversary and explore its rich history:
