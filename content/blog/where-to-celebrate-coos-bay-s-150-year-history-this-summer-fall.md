The renowned American poet Maya Angelou once said, "I have great respect for the past. If you don't know where you've come from, you don't know where you're going." This sentiment rings especially true for **Oregonâ€™s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, a region steeped in indigenous history, maritime heritage, natural beauty, and a resilient community spirit. In downtown Coos Bay, historic buildings stand alongside a diverse array of restaurants, unique shops, museums, and more.
