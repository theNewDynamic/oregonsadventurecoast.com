It’s a little known secret that autumn is one of the best times to visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston, and with the strange summer we just experienced on the West Coast, many of you are probably in need of a break! Spend a few days with us this fall and receive a [15% discount at participating lodging properties](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fall15/) between October 1, 2020- November 30, 2020. Some restrictions apply and subject to change.

Still hesitant to take a road trip? We get it! Fortunately, there is plenty of space to spread out and take in some fabulous [social-distance-friendly activities](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/five-fun-ways-to-social-distance-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) while you’re here. And now that school is back in session, you’ll practically have the region to yourself!

Local hotels are going above and beyond to ensure the safety of their guests with enhanced cleaning, sanitation, and social distancing measures that allow for minimal contact.

There are plenty of ways for you to relax and recharge while you are here

* Explore the beaches and state parks along the Cape Arago Highway.
* Explore the unique shops, restaurants and landmarks in downtown Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston. [Download our map](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.com/img/walking-map-cbnb.pdf).
* Go [crabbing & clamming](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/crabbing-clamming/) or [fishing](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.com/fishing/) in the bay or one of the 30+ local lakes and rivers in the area.
* [Try your luck](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.com/blog/try-your-luck-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) in one of our casinos.
* Spend a day hiking or kayaking at the [South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/NATRES/pages/rs_faqcoastal.aspx#What_is_a_Research_Reserve_).

We could give you more ideas on ways to safely enjoy an Oregon Coast getaway this fall, but we’d rather show you.
