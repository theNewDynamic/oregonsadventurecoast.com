### Girlfriend’s Getaway Itinerary Day One

**LATE MORNING: OREGON DUNES NATIONAL RECREATION AREA & LUNCH**

![](/img/girlfriends-getaway-hdr-695x322.jpg)

After a beautiful, relaxing drive (or flight) to Oregon’s South Coast, your first stop is the [Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/oregon-dunes-national-recreation-area/), the largest expansion of coastal sand dunes in North America. It is here where you will jump start your getaway and experience the joy that can only come with an exhilarating ATV ride up and down towering sand dunes. With more than 32,186 acres of dunes, forest, streams and lakes, there are plenty of opportunities for adventure. We recommend booking your Oregon Dunes ride in advance, and read [Wanted: First Time ATV Riders on the Oregon Dunes](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/wanted-first-time-atv-riders-on-the-oregon-dunes/) to learn how to get started!

After your adrenaline pumping “joy ride”, head over to [Clausen Oysters Bistro](https://www.clausenoysters.com/restaurant/) in North Bend for what will probably be the freshest oysters you’ve ever had. If weather permits, be sure to sit on their patio overlooking the water.

If you and your squad prefer something other than oysters for lunch, you can make the quick drive into downtown Coos Bay and treat yourself to a tasty lunch. There are plenty of options to choose from, but some local favorites include [Shark Bites Seafood Café](http://www.sharkbites.cafe/), [Fisherman’s Seafood Market](https://www.facebook.com/fishermensseafoodmarket), [Coney Station](https://coneystation.business.site/), and [Blue Heron Bistro](http://www.blueheronbistro.net/), just to name a few.

**EARLY AFTERNOON: COOS BAY & A LUXURIOUS SPA TREATMENT**

After lunch, drop by the [Coos Bay Visitor Information Center,](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/) where our friendly staff and volunteers will be happy to answer any questions you may have, and give you local tips! While you’re here, ask us about the [Southern Oregon Coast Charm Trail](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/have-a-charming-adventure-along-the-southern-oregon-coast-charm-trail/), a fun-filled adventure where you explore local destinations and collect individual charms for a one-of-a-kind charm bracelet. Maps are available at the visitor center, or you can [download a map here](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/Charm-Trail-Map.pdf).

While you are in downtown Coos Bay, take some time to explore the unique shops and/or stroll along the Coos Bay Boardwalk, before indulging in a relaxing afternoon massage and/or spa mani/pedi at [The Hair Co. Etc. Salon & Day Spa](https://haircoetc.net/) (we recommend booking ahead of time).

**LATE AFTERNOON: EXPLORE ONE OF OUR MUSEUMS**

If there’s time, your next stop should be the [Coos Art Museum](http://www.coosart.org/) (check the website for current days/times), the cornerstone of visual arts on Oregon’s Southern Coast (be sure to check out the rare personal items of champion runner Steve Prefontaine). If history is more your thing, the [Coos History Museum](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/oregon-s-adventure-coast-spotlight-coos-history-museum/) (check the website for current days/times), Oregon’s oldest continuously operated historical society, has amazing exhibits and features more than 250,000 historic photographs.

**EVENING: DINNER & COSMIC BOWLING**

Once you’ve had your cultural fill, it’s time to head to your hotel and rest up before heading out for drinks and dinner at the [7 Devils Waterfront Alehouse](https://www.7devilsbrewery.com/waterfront-alehouse.html) (reservations are recommended). Later in the evening, let the good times roll as you take in some [Bowling at North Bend Lanes](https://northbendlanes.com/).

You won’t regret a heaping plate of Swedish Pancakes and Lingonberry or Strawberry Croissant French Toast at the [Pancake Mill Restaurant & Pie Shoppe](https://www.pancakemill.com/). _Warning - this place is wildly popular with locals! Get there EARLY or be prepared to wait for a table._ You can also enjoy a fresh, hot breakfast at the [Stockpot Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51813-d7351180-Reviews-Stock_Pot_Restaurant-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html) in Coos Bay, [The Original Cape Cafe ](https://www.facebook.com/The-Cape-Cafe-2132250007095994)in the Charleston Marina, and [Mom’s Kitchen](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g51993-d3464064-Reviews-Mom_s_Kitchen-North_Bend_Oregon.html) in North Bend.

After breakfast, plan to spend a few hours experiencing peace and natural beauty on undeveloped beaches, while exploring some of Oregon’s best state parks along the [Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/).

**AFTERNOON: FRESH SEAFOOD, A WATER ADVENTURE & ICE CREAM**

![](/img/GirlfriendsPage-Triptik.jpg)

Next thing you know, it will be time to grab some fish-n-chips and/or clam chowder from [Monkey Business](https://monkey-business-food-to-go.business.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral) in Charleston (many say it’s the best clam chowder on the Oregon Coast). Other popular Charleston, Oregon lunch spots include [Fisherman’s Grotto](https://www.fishermansgrottoinc.com/), and [Miller’s at the Cove](https://millersatthecove.rocks/).

After lunch, you will unplug and reconnect with nature while exploring the peaceful waterways on a guided kayak tour or a [stand-up paddleboarding (SUP](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation/)) adventure. Need equipment? No problem! [Bahama Boards in Coos Bay ](https://bahamastyles.com/coos-bay-shop/)is a fantastic place to purchase or rent kayaks and paddle boards, in addition to gear, clothing, and accessories. [Waxer’s Surf Shop](https://waxerssurfandskate.com/) also offers rentals, surf, kayak and SUP lessons, while [Canoas Bay Bridge Rentals](https://canoasport.wixsite.com/baybridgerentals) in North Bend offers kayak rentals and other fishing necessities.

If you’re interested in a Guided Paddling Tour, we recommend booking a South Slough Wildlife Viewing Kayak Tour in advance with [South Coast Tours ](https://www.southcoasttours.net/tours/south-slough-coos-bay/)(typically lasts about 2.5 hours) or booking a half-day paddling tour on the Coos Estuary, on the lower Coquille River or on Eel Lake with [Wavecrest Discoveries](http://wavecrestdiscoveries.com/nature-explorations-habitat/).

Be sure to hit the ice cream parlor inside the relatively new [Face Rock Creamery in Coos Bay](https://facerockcreamery.com/), before heading back to your hotel to clean up and rest.

**EVENING: DINNER & CASINO GAMING**

Wind down and enjoy a slightly more upscale restaurant experience at the [Hilltop House Restaurant & Lounge](https://hilltophouserestaurant.com/), [Coach House Restaurant & Lounge](https://www.thecoachhousecoosbayor.com/) or [Restaurant O,](http://restauranto.us/) (_reservations recommended_) before hitting our two [casinos](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/gaming/).

### Girlfriend’s Getaway Itinerary Day Three:

**MORNING: BREAKFAST & GOLDEN AND SILVER FALLS**

![](/img/golden-and-silver-state-park-waterfalls-03-22.jpg)

It’s your final day on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, so make it count! Before heading home, grab a fresh, hot cup of coffee and a delicious pastry at a local coffee shop like[ Bayside Coffee & Tea](https://www.facebook.com/coos.baysidecoffee/) ([download our Coffee Shops, Bakeries, & Specialty Shops Guide ](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/CoffeeShops-Bakery.pdf)for other ideas) and drive to the [Golden & Silver Falls State Natural Area](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=67) where you and your girlfriends will embark on a blissful hike through scenic canyons and lush coastal forests to two magnificent waterfalls. The drive to the falls is part of the adventure (about an hour off Highway 101, on Highway 241), with winding roads that narrow in places - but it’s 100% worth it!

If you’re short on time, the trails at [South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve ](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/ten-things-people-love-about-slough-national-estuarine-research-reserve/)(SSNERR) will have a similar zen-like effect. This glorious nature preserve covers 19,000 acres and offers miles of beautiful hiking trails and waterways to explore for all ability levels. SSNERR is also home to various marine life, plant and bird species - so be sure to bring binoculars with you!
