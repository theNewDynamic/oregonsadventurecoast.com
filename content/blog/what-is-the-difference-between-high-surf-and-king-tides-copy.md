**_Updated November 2022_**

Last year, we published answers to [Our Most Frequently Asked Questions About Winter Storm Watching](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/answers-to-our-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-winter-storm-watching/), but we thought we’d dive in a little deeper to explain the difference between High Surf and King Tides (this is understandably a confusing issue).

**What are King Tides?** The King Tides are winter’s highest tide sequences on the Oregon Coast, and they occur when the Earth, moon, and sun are aligned to produce the greatest tidal effects of the year. The next round is **November 24-26, December 22-24, 2022**, and January 20-22, 2023.

**How is a King Tide Different from a Normal High Tide?** King Tides bring unusually high water levels, and they can cause local tidal flooding. King tides preview how sea-level rise will affect coastal places.

**What’s a “High Surf” Warning?** A High Surf warning goes into effect by the National Weather Service (NWS) when a weather system off the coast is likely to come ashore and bring flooding, dangerous surf, and high winds. These conditions are usually optimal for [winter storm watching](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/storm-watching/) when Pacific storms cause ocean swells of 16 to 35 feet or higher, which often lead to a magnificent show as they crash into the rugged cliffs of our coastline.

**Do King Tides Cause High Surf Conditions?** No. A King Tide without the High Surf is just a lot of water that is higher in the waterways of the area than a normal high tide. A High Surf can be combined with a King Tide but this happens on rare occasions. When such does happen, however, the wave action at Shore Acres State Park can be awe-inspiring and will bring photographers and visitors out in droves. We will post on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast) anytime we have a High Surf Advisory or Warning. If they happen to coincide with a King Tide, we’ll note that too!

Some visitors come to the coast during King Tides in hopes of seeing a spectacular winter storm, while others come as “citizen scientists” to photograph and document the effects of the high tides for the [Oregon King Tides Project](https://kcby.com/search?find=Oregon%20King%20Tides%20Project). While it is always amazing to be on the coast during a King Tide or any other time, we want to ensure our visitors are not disappointed that there may not be storm watching opportunities at the same time.

You can find tips and suggestions online at [the Oregon King Tides website](https://www.oregonkingtides.net/).
