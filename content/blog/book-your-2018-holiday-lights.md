<strong><em>The brightest and most beautiful place on the West Coast shines as brightly as ever in 2018.</em></strong>

Volunteers at <a href="http://www.shoreacres.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shore Acres State Park</a> will soon be hard at work preparing for the <a href="http://www.shoreacres.net/index.php/holiday-lights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annual Holiday Lights Display</a>. This is certainly one of our favorite local holiday traditions and it has captured the attention of media, residents, and visitors from all over the country. This event is very popular so we encourage you to <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/">book your accommodations </a>as soon as possible.

This festive annual display debuts on Thanksgiving Day (Thursday, November 22nd, 2018) and will light up Shore Acres from 4 p.m.-9:30 p.m. each night (including Dec 24th & 25th) thru December 31st, 2018.

The tradition began back in 1987 when a group came together and decided to “string a few lights” to help celebrate the holidays. That first season, 6,000 miniature lights, one large Christmas tree, and the decorated and open Garden House drew 9,000 visitors.

Who knew this would one day bloom into one of the most anticipated holiday events on the Oregon Coast featuring 325,000 dazzling lights (both LED and landscape), thirty Christmas trees, dozens of lighted sculptures, a performance pavilion, and a festive open house?

Bring the whole family and delight in the site of illuminated sea animals, birds, flowers, ships and more. Visitors can also enjoy hot cider, punch, coffee, and cookies served in the Garden House with friends.

This magical display is made possible by Friends of Shore Acres, an estimated 1500 volunteers, the park staff and the financial support of local businesses, the community and the visitors who attend each season. Shore Acres State Park is famous for its beautiful 7-acre botanical gardens, Japanese lily pond, and Garden House- and the holiday light display is nothing less than stunning.
