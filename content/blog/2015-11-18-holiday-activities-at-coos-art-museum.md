# FREE Admission to Coos Art Museum on Saturday, November 28th!

On Saturday, November 28, [Coos Art Museum](http://www.coosart.org/) will be participating in Small Business Saturday and the Noggin Cider Walk sponsored by the [Coos Bay Downtown Association](http://coosbaydowntown.org/) in downtown Coos Bay. **In honor of the event the Museum will be open extended hours from 10 am to 4 pm. Thanks to the thoughtful generosity of <a href="http://www.checkerberrys.com/" target="_blank">Checkerberry’s Flowers & Gifts</a> and <a href="http://www.bayapplianceandtv.com/" target="_blank">Bay Appliance and TV</a> the Coos Art Museum will be open with FREE admission all day.**

So pick-up your mug at Bay Appliance, and stroll on down for yummy refreshments, a little shopping, see the exhibits and help us decorate the Museum for the holiday season. Located in the Museum lobby will be a gingerbread man ornament decorating station. Let your artist escape and help us build a fun garland to celebrate the season and the community. The more participants the better! All ages are welcome to participate in this free activity.

Also scheduled for Saturday the 28th is a holiday card workshop from 10:30 am to 12:30 pm upstairs in the Museum’s art education classroom. Liv Drahos is one of our most popular instructors. This class is for teens through adults. Pre-registration is strongly encouraged as space is limited. The fee for this workshop is $15 for Museum members and $18 for nonmembers. All skill levels are welcome and all materials will be included.

Coos Art Museum is currently featuring five wonderful art exhibitions. These include: Juxtaposed: Installation Art by Renee Couture, Dani Dodge, Allison Hyde and Karin Richardson; Recent Acquisitions to the Permanent Collection; Egyptian Memories by Nancy Hoskins; Emily Ashworth Retrospective; and A Sense of Place. As always the Steve Prefontaine Memorial Gallery will be open for viewing. If you have not been by the Museum recently this is an excellent time to visit and see an outstanding variety of art works.

Coos Art Museum has been a cultural focal point of Oregon’s scenic Southern Coast since 1966. It occupies an historic 1936 Art Deco US Federal Building in downtown Coos Bay. The Museum offers a wide range of arts activities including exhibitions, art classes and lectures. Hours are 10:00am to 4:00pm, Tuesday through Friday and 1:00 to 4:00 pm on Saturday.
