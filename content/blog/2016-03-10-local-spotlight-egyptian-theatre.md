You don’t need to travel across the world to visit a historical Egyptian landmark, there’s one right downtown!  This month’s local spotlight is highlighting one of Coos Bay’s most treasured sites, the <a href="http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/" target="_blank">Egyptian Theatre</a>, a cultural icon of the area since its doors first opened in 1925. In that time it’s become the place to go for movies, live music, and events.

### **Did You Say 1925?!**

That’s right, it first started back in 1925 right in the heart of downtown Coos Bay. But did you know it wasn’t always a theatre? In 1922 the space was originally constructed as the Motor Inn Garage and Service station but it was meant to be, however, as it was right around this moment that a major historical event transpired: King Tutankhamen’s tomb was unearthed.

The American public was fascinated by the allure and mysteries of ancient Egypt, leading to an adoption of what is now known as Egyptian Revival style. The Motor Inn Garage and Service Station was shut down due to building restrictions and the space took on a new form: The Egyptian Theatre.

The Theatre has changed ownership throughout the years, finally being purchased by The City of Coos Bay Urban Renewal Agency in 2006. With the enlisted help of nonprofit <a href="http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/membership-info/" target="_blank">Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association</a>, they have transformed the venue into a showcase for classic and educational movies, hosted concerts, special events, and community celebrations.

This theatre was recently featured on <a href="http://kcby.com/features/western-oregon-living" target="_blank">KCBY’s Western Oregon Living</a>. Take a look-
