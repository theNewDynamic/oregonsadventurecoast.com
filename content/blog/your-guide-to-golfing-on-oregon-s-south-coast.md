## Tips for Golfing on Oregon's South Coast

Here are a few tips to help you make the most of your golfing adventure.

**\# 1. Prepare for the Weather.** Oregon’s South Coast is known for its variable weather conditions. It's not uncommon to experience sunshine, wind, and rain all in one round. Dress in layers to stay comfortable, and pack a lightweight, waterproof jacket. Don't forget a hat and sunscreen, as the weather can change quickly.

**\# 2. Mind the Wind.** Breezy and windy conditions can be common in this region, which could impact your game. Adjust your stance and swing to account for the wind. Tee the ball lower to minimize its exposure to the wind and focus on maintaining a smooth, controlled swing. On windy days, it’s ideal to use a soft golf ball designed to perform better in the wind.

**\# 3. Pack Like a Pro.** If you’re planning to golf at a walking-only golf resort like [Bandon Dunes Golf Resort](https://bandondunesgolf.com/golf/), be prepared to walk more than 6 miles by wearing well broken-in golf shoes and premium quality socks. Golf bags should be a single carry bag with a single or double strap that does not exceed 25 pounds.
