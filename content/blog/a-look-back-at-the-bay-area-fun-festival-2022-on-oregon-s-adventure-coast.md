It seems like only yesterday we were telling the world that [summer fun is just getting started](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/summer-fun-is-just-getting-started-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**! But with the conclusion of the Annual Bay Area Fun Festival, Cruz the Coos and Prefontaine Run - summer has come to an official end. If you couldn’t make it this year, hope to see you next time (or sooner)! Here’s a recap on what you missed.

**Annual Bay Area Fun Festival September 17-18, 2022**

The 2022 Bay Area Fun Festival (a.k.a. the last big party of the summer) in Coos Bay was one for the records! After being on pause for the last 2 years due to COVID, the world was more than ready to welcome back the merriment, the K-DOCK RockFest, street vendors, unique wares, delicious food and drink, and a parade through downtown Coos Bay! This event ran in conjunction with the [Annual Cruz the Coos and Show ‘n Shine](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-cruz-the-coos/) (9/17-9/18) and [Prefontaine Memorial Run](https://prefontainerun.com/)(9/18). Have a look at some highlights from the festival.

**2022 Cruz The Coos**

The 3rd weekend of September also brought us the return of the Annual Cruz the Coos and Show ‘n Shine, the longest-running and largest classic car cruise on the Oregon Coast! Hundreds gathered at The Mill Casino Hotel and RV Park for the Show n’ Shine to see the beautifully restored vintage cars and trucks, before gathering to watch these beauties “cruz” the streets of Coos Bay.

Proceeds generated from the event, presented by The Coos Bay-North Bend Rotary Club, are being used by the Rotary club to fund projects throughout the area, including scholarships, humanitarian efforts, and other non-profit organizations in the community. More than 300 classic cars were in the “cruz” this year. Here are some of our favorite images.

**Annual Prefontaine Memorial Run**

After a 2 year hiatus, hundreds of runners from all over the region came to Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston to participate in the **41st Annual Prefontaine Memorial Run**, a challenging 10K road race taking runners along international track star Steve Prefontaine’s old training courses. Spirits were high as runners crossed the finish line at Marshfield High School, where Pre’s illustrious running career began. You can see the race results[here](https://theworldlink.com/sports/area-residents-win-age-groups-in-prefontaine-memorial-run/article_389815e2-39f0-11ed-8fe0-1bc56017353b.html).
