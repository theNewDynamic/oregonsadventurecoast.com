> Aside from the natural beauty, one of the things that travelers say they love the most about visiting Oregon’s Adventure Coast is the food. Self-proclaimed “food-snobs” visiting from large cities all over the region have told us time and time again how impressed they are with the quality and the selection of the restaurants in our area. Hungry travelers can find world-class chowder, fresh local seafood, top-notch sushi, Thai, Italian, Mexican, and American comfort food within just a couple of miles of each other.

> Dining in local establishments is a wonderful way to meet new people and get an authentic sense of the history and culture in our area. We recently asked some of the locals and frequent visitors to share their favorite restaurant recommendations on Facebook.
