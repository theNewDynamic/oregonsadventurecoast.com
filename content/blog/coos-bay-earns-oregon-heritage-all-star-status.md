**Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** is proud to announce that the city of Coos Bay has earned the prestigious title of [Oregon Heritage All-Star Community](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/OH/Documents/All-Star%20Designation%20Guidelines.pdf), a distinction awarded by the [Oregon Heritage/State Historic Preservation Office](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/oh/pages/default.aspx). This honor coincides with Coos Bay’s 150th anniversary, celebrating its rich indigenous and maritime roots. “Coos Bay has a long and broad history,” said Katie Henry, coordinator for the Oregon Heritage Commission [in a press release](https://apps.oregon.gov/oregon-newsroom/OR/OPRD/Posts/Post/Coos-Bay-receives-Oregon-Heritage-All-Star-Community-designation). “The efforts of the city, tribes, museums, businesses, and community members in preserving and sharing local history contributes to the economy and livability of Coos Bay.”
