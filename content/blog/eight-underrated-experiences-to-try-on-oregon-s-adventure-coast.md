What makes **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** truly one-of-a-kind? Is it the smell of the salty air as you take an early morning walk on [Basterndorff Beach?](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) The fantastic ocean views and colorful blooms in [Shore Acres State Park](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) or the golden hour glow at [Sunset Bay State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=70)? Or how about those epic sand dunes you can hike, bike, and [ride an ATV](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/atv-motorsports/) along on the [Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/untamed-dunes/)?

Sure, these iconic Oregon Coast destinations certainly deserve every bit of appreciation they get, but dig a little deeper, and you'll find many off-the-radar experiences that also offer a memorable travel experience.

Of course, you should come to enjoy the headline attractions, but if you stop there, you're only scratching the surface. In this post, we'll introduce you to some of the lesser-known destinations, experiences, and local businesses on Oregon's Adventure Coast, waiting to be explored year-round. We hope you'll take the time to discover some of these "off-the-beaten-path" treasures during your next visit!

### \#1) Enjoy a Round of Disc Golf with a View at Ferry Road Park

Did you know that tucked away between the McCullough Bridge spanning the Bay and downtown North Bend is a lovely green oasis complete with picnic areas, walking trails, open fields, a playground, a small beach area, and a delightful disc golf course? Ferry Road Park features a moderately challenging [9-hole disc golf course](https://udisc.com/courses/ferry-road-park-z1D4) that weaves through forested areas and sections of the park, offering both fun and challenges for beginners and seasoned players alike. Players can enjoy views of the bay, glimpses of the McCullough Bridge, and plenty of fresh air.

If you want to feel like you have the Oregon Coast to yourself, [Cape Arago State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=66), the unsung hero of the Cape Arago Beach Loop, is where you want to be. It is usually quieter than its popular sister parks, [Sunset Bay State Park and Shore Acres State Park](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/), but make no mistake, Cape Arago State Park is a must-see destination! Visitors love the rugged cliffs, hiking trails, ocean views, abundant wildlife, and tide pools in the South Cove, teeming with entire marine ecosystems. Shell Island, just offshore, is home to barking sea lions year-round.
