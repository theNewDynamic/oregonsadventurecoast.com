Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston is currently in Phase 2 of Oregon’s re-opening plan so that means that non-essential travel is allowed! [Here’s what travelers can expect](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/ready.set.adventure-what-travelers-can-expect-as-we-reopen-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) under our current re-opening phase. Our [local hotels](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/how-hotels-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast-are-keeping-guests-safe/), restaurants, and businesses are going the extra mile to keep our visitors and locals safe. Face coverings are required in public spaces. To protect our communities, we ask everyone to follow Oregon’s Safe+Strong guidelines.

Summer is here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, but things are a little different this year. It is true that many of our annual events, concerts, and gatherings are postponed or canceled out of an abundance of caution related to COVID-19. However, you can still celebrate summer with us and stay safe while social distancing! Here are some local (secret) tips of the best spots to social distance yourself on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

**1. Visit longer stretches of beach.** We are known for our [beautiful, undeveloped beaches](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) with seemingly limitless space and plenty of opportunities to spread out. Go during off-peak hours like before 9 a.m. and/or on weekdays to find even more open space. Horsfall Beach, Bastendorff Beach, Lighthouse Beach, and Whiskey Run Beach all provide long stretches of beach, interesting coves to explore and plenty of room to social distance! However, be sure to bring your mask just in case and avoid congregating in the parking lot.

**2. Hike along the Cape Arago Loop Trail.** There are plenty of [amazing hiking trails](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking/) to choose from on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, but this 6-mile round trip hiking trail takes you along the rugged coastline and through mysterious and beautiful coastal forests. Paths are wide enough that if you encounter other hikers, it’s easy to step aside and let them pass and still keep your distance. Wearing a gaiter around your neck that you can pull up to cover your nose & mouth when you encounter others on the trail will help keep you and them safe.

**3. Kayak in the South Slough or Coos Bay.** The abundance of lakes, rivers, ocean bays, and estuaries on Oregon’s Adventure Coast makes this an [ideal destination for kayakers](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation/) of all skill levels. A single kayak gives you plenty of opportunities to really space yourself with others on the water. You can bring your own kayak (BYOK) or rent from one of the outfitters in Coos Bay. Outfitters will also give you great advice on where to put in and tips on what to see once on the water.

**4. Explore Golden & Silver Falls.** [Golden & Silver Falls State Natural Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2016-02-05-adventure-spotlight-golden-and-silver-falls/) has been called by many “a hidden gem in the dense coastal forests”. The winding road that leads to the falls is part of the adventure! Once at the falls’ main parking lot, take the trails that lead to the bases of both waterfalls or up to the top of Golden Falls. Trails here are wide and of moderate difficulty. Vantage points all along the trail give you excellent views of the falls from the bottom, mid-point, and top.

**5. Dine on a picnic table.** Along the Coos Bay Boardwalk, in the Prefontaine Mural Plaza, and in various city parks, visitors will find picnic tables. Pick up your favorite take out from one of our many amazing restaurants and dine along the bay or in the trees. To be extra safe, bring along your own [tablecloth](https://amzn.to/39NFZVw) and pin it down with [clips](https://amzn.to/37GCBdG) or [weights](https://amzn.to/2vOlhGk).
