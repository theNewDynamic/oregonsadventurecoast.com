*“There are some places you just need to see to believe, and Shore Acres Park is one of them -”* [The Travel](https://www.thetravel.com/what-to-do-in-shore-acres-park-oregon/)

Just 13 miles southwest of Coos Bay sits one of the most beloved destinations in the Oregon State Park System, on top of ancient sandstone cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Once the luxurious private estate of timber and shipping tycoon, [Louis J. Simpson](https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/simpson_louis_j_1877_1949_/#.YDhAz-hKhaQ), Shore Acres State Park has evolved into a treasured destination among locals and visitors to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**. [Willamette Week](https://www.wweek.com/promotions/2022/05/17/heres-everything-i-plan-to-do-on-my-summer-trip-to-the-southern-oregon-coast/) says a visit to Shore Acres is “like stepping into a magical Disney movie, or maybe a Monet painting - truly an escape.”

The 745-acre park features incredible vistas of the ocean making it a primo destination for [Whale Watching](https://www.centraloregondaily.com/news/pets-animals-nature/oregon-coast-spring-whale-watch/article_f2f76124-8654-5688-979e-ab7756bfde8c.html) each winter and spring, as well as a secret beach ([Simpson Beach](https://shoreacres.net/about-us/simpson-reef-and-shell-island/)), a winter storm watching hut, hiking trails, an [Information and Gift Center](https://shoreacres.net/infogift-center/), a famous 95-foot tall Monterey Pine dating back to the historic Louis J. Simpson estate (the oldest in Oregon) and an annual holiday lights display that brings in visitors from all over the world. However, it is perhaps the immaculate 7-acre botanical garden and Japanese-style zen garden surrounding a lily pond that Shore Acres State Park is best known for.

Many of the plants and flowers on display today were inspired by the original garden Simpson created to complement his grand estate. 100 years later, thousands of carefully curated flowering annuals and perennials from all over the world, including roses, rhododendrons, azaleas, dahlias, lily pads, and many unique plant varieties, continue to dazzle Oregon Coast visitors.

May through September boasts lush summer foliage with over 5,000 flowering annuals and perennials from all over the world. June through September features more than 800 [rose](https://shoreacres.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/RoseCard-2016-4x9-2-fold-Fnl-2-web.pdf) bushes with gorgeous blooming All American varieties.
