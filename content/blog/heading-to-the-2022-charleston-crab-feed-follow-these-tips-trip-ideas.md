**_Don’t Risk Missing Out on the Ultimate Oregon Coast Crab Experience! Get Your Tickets for the Charleston Crab Feed NOW!_**

**Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** is known for scenic beauty and fantastic adventures, but did you know that February is one of the best months to get your fresh Oregon Dungeness crab fix?

If you're still feeling crabby that last year’s Charleston Crab Feed was cancelled due to COVID precautions, we've got great news for you! **The Annual Charleston Crab Feed will be back and better than ever on Saturday, February 12, 2022** from 11am-3pm!

Now in its 37th year (after skipping 2021), [tickets for this heavenly feast](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/37th-annual-charleston-crab-feed-tickets-228598854327) are available now, and going fast! The crab feed is one of our favorite annual affairs, because it brings the community together. The event features

* Whole or half crab dinners (dine-in and take-out options are available) at market price with side dishes and a roll.
* Add a dessert or choose the Hot Dog option for those who don’t like crab!!!
* Raffle drawings provided by local businesses.

All proceeds help support the Charleston Visitor Center.

Crab feasts and community events have a long rich history here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. Here are some photos from previous crabbing events courtesy of [Coos History Museum](https://cooshistory.org/).
