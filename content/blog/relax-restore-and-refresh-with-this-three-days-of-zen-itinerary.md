## **Day One**&nbsp;

After making the beautiful drive to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, you’ll want to suit up and kick off your Zen getaway with some lovely [<u>water recreation</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation/)!&nbsp; With so many lakes, rivers, ocean bays, and estuaries on Oregon’s South Coast, there are many options to choose from. However, Stand-Up-Paddleboarding is one of our favorite ways to dive into total relaxation.

### **Afternoon Spa Treatment**&nbsp;

After a blissful few hours experiencing the Oregon Coast from the water, head back to the hotel to clean up before heading to your afternoon spa treatments! Get a massage, infusion, mani/pedi or other relaxing service at a local Day Spa. Here are two that we recommend:&nbsp;

## **Day Two**

### Breakfast

Wake up and fuel up for Day Two of total relaxation with a hot breakfast and espresso or other coffee specialty drink at [<u>So It Goes Coffeehouse</u>](https://www.soitgoescoffee.com/). While you’re there, take some time to walk along the boardwalk and explore some shops and boutiques in downtown Coos Bay, before heading to Golden and Silver Falls. Or bring along your journal and take some time to self-reflect.&nbsp;

### Yoga

After you’ve spent some time fostering a sense of morning peace and calm, it’s time to jump into an a.m. yoga or meditation class! Here are a few local destinations you may want to explore:&nbsp;

* [<u>Charlo Mindfulness Center</u>](http://charlomindfulness.com/) 1260 N. Bayshore Drive, Suite 204 ● Coos Bay ● (541) 808-2008 The Center provides Vinyasa yoga classes, mindfulness courses, personalized coaching, and creative writing workshops, in addition to special events that celebrate the pursuit of creative and mindful connections.

### Hike to Golden and Silver Falls&nbsp;

After you’ve achieved that fresh “I just went to yoga class” glow, head to the grab-and-go deli at [<u>Coos Head Food Co-op</u>](https://coosheadfood.coop/news/cooshead/co-op-grab-go-deli) to pick up a healthy picnic lunch before making the 26-mile drive (approximtely one hour) to the [<u>Golden &amp; Silver Falls State Natural area</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/). Not only is it one of the most beloved ‘hidden gems’ in our region, the drive itself is part of the magical Zen-inspired adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Spend the late morning connecting with your natural surroundings by mindfully walking through dense coastal forests, enjoying stunning river views, majestic Oregon myrtle trees, and spectacular views of the falls.&nbsp; The best part is you don’t even have to be a skilled or expert hiker to reap the rewards of your journey! Two relatively short hikes lead to the bases of these breathtaking waterfalls shooting out onto boulders a hundred feet below.&nbsp;

Take a break for lunch at one of the picnic tables near the parking area, then try out the more strenuous hike to the mid-point of Silver Falls and the top of Golden Falls. The views are worth the effort!

Walking mindfully in these natural areas can help reduce stress, improve mood, and boost the immune system. Research has shown that spending time in nature can lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, and increase levels of serotonin, a hormone associated with happiness and well-being.&nbsp;

Plan to spend several hours here before heading back into town.&nbsp;

### Dinner&nbsp;

Grab a take-out dinner from [<u>Himalayan Restaurant and Bar</u>](https://www.talech.com/biz/ordering/514286/HIMALAYAN-RESTAURANT-BAR-COOS-BAY-OR?fbclid=IwAR2u8k6ZC5rgumnIOPUAcOytdMDRpfG6ziARbt3Rc2TTPMipzfL_71KX4_g#/menu) or you can even try one of the food trucks at [<u>Front Street Food Trucks - Food Court,</u>](https://www.facebook.com/frontstreetfoodtrucks) and head to Sunset Bay State Park for a picnic and beautiful evening stroll as you watch the sun go down. [<u>Horsfall Beach</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches) (adjacent to the [<u>Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/)), Mingus Park and Simpson Park are also lovely destinations where one can relax and connect with nature. Later that evening, we recommend heading to [<u>Back Alley Pub</u>](https://northbendlanes.com/Back-Alley-Pub-Grill) for a fun night of entertainment, along with a brew or two. You earned it!

## Day Three&nbsp;

### Breakfast

After so much activity the day prior, you may want to treat yourself to an extra hour or so of sleep before checking out of your hotel. Head over to [<u>Green Street Organic Juice Bar</u>](https://www.facebook.com/GreenStreetJuice/) or [<u>Blue Heron Bistro</u>](http://www.blueheronbistro.net/) for a delicious brunch before heading out on one last Zen-inspired adventure on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.&nbsp;

### Cape Arago Beach Loop & Forest Bathing&nbsp;

A morning drive along the [<u>Cape Arago Beach Loop</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) and taking part in some [<u>forest bathing</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/forest-bathing/) (also known as Shinrin-yoku and forest therapy) is the perfect way to conclude your Zen getaway while experiencing the very best of the Oregon Coast. What is forest bathing, you ask? It is the practice of immersing oneself in nature to improve physical and mental health. It involves spending time in forests, parks, or other natural environments and using all five senses to connect with nature, and has been shown to help reduce stress, improve mood, and boost the immune system.&nbsp;

While driving along the Cape Arago Beach Loop, visitors will have access to beaches and state parks that offer breathtaking vantage points along with views of the famous Oregon Coast seals and sea lions. To get there, hop on Hwy 101 and head west on Newmark Avenue (just south of The Mill Casino). Follow the road until you reach the big curve to the left, taking you onto Cape Arago Hwy. Follow this road into Charleston, once you cross the bridge into Charleston, the road will fork; veer to the right to head for the docks, or veer to the left to follow the Cape Arago Beach Loop. This road will eventually loop back around.&nbsp;

[<u>Shore Acres State Park</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/), with its amazing cliffs and gorgeous botanical gardens, is one of our favorite spots for forest bathing, but visitors can also find peace and mindfulness on the coastal forest trail along the cliffs between [<u>Sunset Bay State Park</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) and [<u>Cape Arago State Park</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/), [<u>Bastendorff Beach</u>](https://www.co.coos.or.us/parksrec/page/bastendorff), and [<u>Yoakam Point</u>](https://stateparks.com/yoakam_point_state_natural_site_in_oregon.html). While you are taking in the amazing natural beauty throughout Shore Acres State Park, be sure to explore [<u>Simpson Reef and Shell Island</u>](https://shoreacres.net/about-us/simpson-reef-and-shell-island/).

where you will find crashing waves, migrating whales, and views of hundreds of seals, sea lions, seabirds and other marine wildlife. Bring your binoculars for the best viewing.

### Lunch

As your time on Oregon’s Adventure Coast comes to a close, be sure to grab some fresh seafood at one of our local seafood restaurants like [<u>Fisherman’s Market on the Boardwalk</u>](https://www.facebook.com/fishermensseafoodmarket/). Or, if you prefer, head to North Bend for some irresistible homemade vegetarian and vegan grub at [<u>The Tin Thistle</u>](https://www.facebook.com/thetinthistlecafe/) - a favorite with visitors and locals alike! If possible, ask to be seated in their outdoor garden patio in the back for a true ‘Zen' like experience. Make sure you try the vegan mac and cheese (some visitors say it's the best they’ve ever had) and/or one of their to die for burgers - all vegan! It’s the perfect way to wrap up 3 days of Zen-like bliss!&nbsp;
