Like actual fun? If you have to think about this, you need to book a trip immediately to Oregon's South Coast to enjoy one of our end-of-summer festivals.

Each year, we send summer off with a bang with a series of free concerts and festivals that draw thousands of visitors to our area. If you want to squeeze in ONE more getaway this summer, mark your calendars and book your reservations immediately for these end-of-summer celebrations listed below.

While you are here, enjoy a free <a href="http://musiconthebayoregon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music on the Bay </a> concert every Tuesday evening in September in Mingus Park and be sure to hit the wildly popular <a href="http://coosbaydowntown.org/farmers-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coos Bay Farmers Market</a> on Wednesdays before it wraps up for the summer season.
