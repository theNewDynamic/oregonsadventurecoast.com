If you have never visited [Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/) during our “off-season”, you are missing out! [Travel Oregon’s Emily Forsha](http://traveloregon.com/author/eforsha/) says winter is her favorite season on the Oregon Coast. “You might find yourself cozying up by a fireplace, watching angry waves crash during a spectacular storm; or you may find yourself on an uncrowded beach on a clear, sunny day that ends with a sunset over a beach bonfire,” she writes in her post,[*The Oregon Coast, A Winter Odyssey*](http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/oregon-stories/the-oregon-coast-a-winter-odyssey/%20).

The towns of Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston are year-round destinations, offering visitors plenty of opportunities for relaxation and adventure whether it is winter, spring, summer or fall. Despite what you may hear about cold and rainy Oregon winters, it’s not uncommon for coastal residents and visitors to be treated to spectacular balmy days of sunshine and warmer temperatures. Visitors can often find great hotel deals in the winter months - [click here](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/) to find the best rates on hotel stays.

Here are some other reasons to visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast this winter.

### It’s Prime Time for Whale Watching!

![](/img/_oregon-whale-watch-week-blog-695x322-jpg.jpg)

Whales can sometimes be spotted off the shores of Oregon's Adventure Coast throughout the year, but peak winter migrating season for gray whales is mid-December through mid-January. This year, volunteers from the[Whale Watching Spoken Here®](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=thingstodo.dsp_whalewatching) program will be available in [designated locations](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&amp;t=m&amp;msa=0&amp;z=7&amp;source=embed&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;mid=zweC21xpv7NQ.krK2xC0y40W4) (like [Shore Acres State Park](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/)) between 10am and 1pm the week of December 28, 2022 – Sunday, January 1, 2023. It is estimated that up to 18,000 gray whales will pass by the Oregon Coast as they travel south to the warm lagoons of Baja Mexico. Of course, Whale Watch Week is an ideal time for whale watching, but Oregon Coast visitors often see the migrating gray whales blowing, breaching and fluking well into the month of January.

### Winter Storm Watching

![](/img/winter-storm-watching-oregon-coast-questions-answered-blog-695x322-jpg.png)You just never know when a winter storm system will break out over the Pacific, resulting in a show like none other. While we wish we could give our visitors exact dates and times for prime winter storm watching, we can tell you that the best time to view them is during the months between November and March. The Oregon Coast is known for its unpredictability, and what appears to be a quiet, balmy ocean one day can churn massive waves resulting from wild winter storms the next. Winter storm watchers will find multiple vantage points to view the massive waves crashing into the rugged coastline along [the Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/). We will post High Surf Warnings on our[Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast/), so be sure to follow us. Please [read this post](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/how-to-stay-safe-while-winter-storm-watching/) on how to safely view and photograph the wondrous winter storm waves.
