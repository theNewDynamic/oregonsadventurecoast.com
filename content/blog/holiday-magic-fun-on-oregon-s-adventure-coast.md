Who’s looking forward to this year’s holiday season? We are! Not only will the [Holiday Lights at Shore Acres](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-holiday-lights-at-shore-acres/) be back after a two year hiatus, holiday magic will be all around **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**! With November upon us, it's the perfect time to feature some of the upcoming events you will want to experience this 2022 holiday season!

If you’re among those traveling from out-of-town to see the holiday lights this year, we hope you’ll stick around and experience more of what Oregon’s Adventure Coast has to offer. Here are a few points of interest to add to your itinerary this holiday season (in no particular order).

* **Charleston Marine Life Center** - Located on the edge of the harbor in Charleston, the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology’s Charleston Marine Life Center is an exciting place for discovery. Aquaria highlighting different coastal ecosystems, a tidepool touch tank, whale and sea lion skeletons, underwater video from deep reefs and undersea volcanoes, and a variety of specimens reveal the hidden and remarkable diversity of life off Oregon, from the coast to the deep sea. Open Wednesday through Saturday 11am-5pm. [www.charlestonmarinelifecenter.com](http://www.charlestonmarinelifecenter.com)
* **The Mill Casino and Three Rivers Casino** - Yes, we have not one, but TWO casinos in Coos Bay and North Bend offering some of the most fun-filled, Vegas-style and casino-gaming in the Pacific Northwest. [www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/gaming](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/gaming/)
* **Coos Art Museum** - Housed in a former US Post Office building, this is the 3rd oldest art museum in Oregon.
