### ✔ Layered Clothing

It’s best to assume fluctuating weather; anticipate cold weather when making an early morning departure, but be prepared for direct sunlight once the sun comes out. It’s also important to remember that even the warmest of days can experience a big drop in temperature when offshore. Layered clothing allows you to adjust for changes in temperature accordingly. Be sure that part of your layer clothing includes a waterproof jacket and rain pants.

### ✔ Gloves

Not only will gloves protect you from both sunburn and cold temperatures associated with the previous tip, they will protect you from line cuts.

### ✔ A Hat

A hat is paramount when sitting out on the water in the direct sunlight. Be sure to bring a wide brimmed hat, a baseball hat, or anything else that will provide some shade. Additionally, a hat can help keep you warm on those cold days.

### ✔ Sunscreen

Be sure to have sunscreen on hand and apply generously every few hours. Even on overcast days, you can get a sunburn!

### ✔ Polarized Sunglasses

As cuts and scrapes are a possibility whenever fishing, a good first aid kit is essential. The kit should include band aids, antiseptic cream, hand sanitize, and seasickness medication.

### ✔ Life Jacket

### ✔ Camera

When you finally land that epic catch, you’ll no doubt want to snap a picture or two to share. A camera/phone will come in handy, just be sure to store it in a…

### ✔ Waterproof Bag

Bring a waterproof ziplock and/or other sealable bag to hold your electronics and valuables.

### ✔ Cooler

If you’re bringing drinks or snacks with you, a cooler will be invaluable. Fill it with some ice and you’re good to go!
