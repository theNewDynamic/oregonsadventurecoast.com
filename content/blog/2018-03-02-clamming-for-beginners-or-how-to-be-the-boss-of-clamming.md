If you've been anywhere along the Oregon Coast, you've probably heard a lot about clamming; but you might be wondering why it's so popular among natives and visitors. Clamming is appealing to many Oregonians and visitors because it is relatively easy and the reward is a tasty treat best served in chowder, steamed or fried. There are no special skills required, no expensive equipment, and beginners can usually pick it up quite easily.



The low tides commonly found from Empire to Charleston make our region one of the top destinations for clam digging. Local bait &amp; tackle shops are usually the best resource for first (and second, third, fourth) time clammers and can usually advise on conditions, regulations, equipment, etc. Some businesses like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/basintacklecharleston/">Basin Tackle</a> on Kingfisher Rd in Coos Bay even offer classes on how to use a clam pump and clean the clams (they even share secret recipes)!



Owner Rob Gensorek suggests showing at the times listed below fifteen to thirty minutes early to rent or buy your gear but the class itself is always FREE.  Just bring a <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/travelers-guide/fishing-license-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shellfish license</a> and you can rent a 48 hour clam pump and bucket rental for $15.00. Rubber boots are also available for just $5.00 a day. Here's the 2018 class schedule below. Dates and times are subject to change and may be weather dependent.  We recommend calling (541) 888-3474 to confirm.

Don't be afraid to try a clamming adventure this spring!  We've got tips, video tutorials and recipes to help!



Ready to give it a shot?  Here are some more tips for first-time clammers:

<h3>1. Get your shellfish license.</h3>

Clams can be harvested all year on our coast, but ODFW does require a license. <a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/licenses_regs/shellfish.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to get your license.

<h3>2. Wear waterproof boots (trust us).</h3>

Just take a look at the photos and you will see the necessity of waterproof boots. Otherwise, you may loose or ruin your shoes!

<h3>3. Dress in layers!</h3>

Doesn't matter what season it is, it can get chilly out there! Dress in layers that can get dirty.

<h3>4. Go to a bait and tackle shop before you head out.</h3>

Some of the best advice you will receive will probably come from one of the fishing experts at one of our <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/travelers-guide/fishing-license-requirements/#baitshops" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local bait and tackle stores</a>. They can tell you when the best time of day to dig would be based on the tides. They can also help you make sure you have the right equipment- a bucket, a shovel (can be rented or borrowed) and/or a tube a.k.a. a "clam gun".

<h3>5. Keep track of how many clams you dig.</h3>

You are allowed 20 bay clams per day in the aggregate, however, only 12 of which may be Gaper or Empire clams; again this is something someone at a local bait and tackle shop can help you with.<a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/mrp/shellfish/regulations.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Click here </a>for ODFW's Regulations Summary for Marine Shellfish.
