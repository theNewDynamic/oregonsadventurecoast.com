> ### “The new Coos History Museum & Maritime Collection is designed to celebrate our unique regional identity and heritage. It ensures that today’s visitors, and future generations, will understand the story of the people, places, and events that make Oregon’s South Coast special.” – <a href="http://cooshistory.org/center_overview" target="_blank">Coos History Museum & Maritime Collections</a>

There’s a new attraction in town, and we think you’re going to want to stay a little longer on your next “South Coast Adventure”. The <a href="http://www.cooshistory.org" target="_blank">Coos History Museum</a> has opened their vibrant, waterfront facility to the public; ushering in a new era of cultural and tourism for Coos Bay’s historic Front Street.

The new state-of-the-art facility will enable the <a href="http://www.cooshistory.org/" target="_blank">Coos County Historical Society </a>to better preserve the South Coast’s history and share its story with more visitors and residents than ever before. The museum now features a range of interactive exhibits and resources designed to preserve the rich maritime and cultural history in Coos County while visitors enjoy beautiful views of the bay.

Executive director Frank Smoot says he hopes the community will play a big role in planning for future exhibits. “As you see exhibits and think, ‘wow, I wish there was something on this topic or that topic,’ let us know. We’re not the sort of museum that’s going to have the same exhibit up for 20 years,” he told <a href="http://www.kcby.com/news/local/Coos-History-Museum-holding-Independence-Day-soft-opening-310775071.html" target="_blank">KCBY News</a>.  They also plan to showcase outside maritime artifacts on their equally impressive exterior grounds.

The Coos History Museum’s new location is right off Hwy. 101 and has plenty of parking space to accommodate field trips and large group tours. Visitors will also want to explore the other historical sites on Front Street, like the Marshfield Sun Printing Museum, the Coos Bay Iron Works, and the Coos Bay Boardwalk.

The Coos History Museum is open Tuesday-Sunday 10 a.m. – 6 p.m. Closed on Mondays.
