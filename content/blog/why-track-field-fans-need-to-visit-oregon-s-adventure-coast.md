## **_Traveling to Oregon to Watch the 2022 World Athletics Championships? Take a Side Trip to Steve Prefontaine’s Hometown!_**

The [2022 World Athletics Championships](https://worldathletics.org/competitions/world-athletics-championships/oregon22/event-info) are coming to Oregon July 15–24, 2022! Nearly 2,000 of the world’s greatest athletes representing more than 200 nations will travel to Eugene, Oregon this summer to compete in this unprecedented event happening at Hayward Field at the University of Oregon. This will mark the first time the U.S. will host this elite, global sporting event.

Visitors and event spectators will want to venture out and explore the many other wonderful destinations in Oregon like **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**. There are many reasons why runners and sports fans love to travel here. There is an abundance of natural running and hiking trails, temperate weather and coastal beauty that can’t be found anywhere else in the country. 

However, there is one primary reason Oregon’s Adventure Coast is a popular destination with running fans. Visitors from all over the world have traveled here to explore the hometown of internationally acclaimed track star[ **Steve Prefontaine,**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/steve-prefontaine-story/) who helped to inspire the American running craze that began in the mid-1970s.

{{< floatimage src="img/prefontaine-tall-image.jpg" float="right" alt="Prefontaine thousand miler" size="100" >}}

Steve Prefontaine, or “Pre”, as he was called, was born and raised in **Coos Bay, Oregon**, and graduated from [Marshfield High School](http://marshfield.cbd9.net/). Upon entering the [University of Oregon](http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=30594) in 1969, he was one of the most highly recruited high school track athletes ever, and went on to compete in international meets, including the **1972 Olympics**, against the USSR, Germany, Great Britain and a combined European team. His life was tragically cut short in a car accident at the age of 24. At the time of his death, Pre held every American distance running record from 2-miles through 10,000 meters.

Runners from all over the world travel here each year to compete in the[ Prefontaine Memorial Run](http://prefontainerun.com/run-info.php), a challenging 10K road race across one of his former training courses, with its finish line at the high school track where he first competed. This event is sanctioned by the[ Road Runners Club of America](http://www.rrca.org/). The [41st Annual Prefontaine Memorial Run is currently slated to take place September 17th, 2022](https://prefontainerun.com/run-information.html).

“At no place is the celebration of Steve Prefontaine and his story more personal than in Coos Bay, Oregon, where he was born in 1951 and discovered his gift for running fast and far as a student at Marshfield High School,” event organizers posted on the event website. “Here, he developed his hunger to be the best in the field, and more, to do it with style—to create beauty when he ran, to show people something they had never seen before.”
