## _Traveling to Oregon to Watch the 2021 U.S. Olympic Team Trials - Track & Field Event? Take a Side Trip to Steve Prefontaine’s Hometown!_

After a year of lock-downs, event cancellations, social distancing, travel bans and masking - we are finally recognizing signs that life may soon return to normal! The [2021 U.S. Olympic Team Trials - Track & Field](https://www.usatf.org/events/2021/2020-u-s-olympic-team-trials-track-field) happening in Eugene, Oregon June 18 - 27, 2021 is most certainly a sign of big and exciting things ahead! It’s hard to compete with the energy and excitement of an Olympic Team Trials event at Hayward Field, but fans may want to venture out and explore other wonderful destinations Oregon offers like **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**.

There are many reasons why runners and sports fans love to travel here. There is an abundance of natural running and hiking trails, temperate weather and coastal beauty that can’t be found anywhere else in the country. However, there is one primary reason Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston is a popular destination with running fans. Visitors from all over the world have traveled to Oregon’s Adventure Coast to explore the hometown of internationally acclaimed track star[ Steve Prefontaine,](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/steve-prefontaine-story/) who helped to inspire the American running craze that began in the mid-1970s.

{{< floatimage src="img/prefontaine-tall-image.jpg" float="right" alt="Prefontaine thousand miler" size="100" >}}

Steve Prefontaine, or “Pre”, as he was called, was born and raised in Coos Bay, Oregon, and graduated from [Marshfield High School](http://marshfield.cbd9.net/). Upon entering the [University of Oregon](http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=30594) in 1969, he was one of the most highly recruited high school track athletes ever, and went on to compete in international meets against the USSR, Germany, Great Britain and a combined European team. His life was tragically cut short in a car accident at the age of 24. At the time of his death, Pre held every American distance running record from 2-miles through 10,000 meters.

With the exception of 2020, runners from all over the world have traveled here on an annual basis to compete in the [Prefontaine Memorial Run](http://prefontainerun.com/run-info.php), a challenging 10K road race across one of his former training courses, with its finish line at the high school track where he first competed. This event is sanctioned by the [Road Runners Club of America](http://www.rrca.org/). The 2021 Annual Prefontaine Memorial Race is currently scheduled for September 18th, 2021.

“At no place is the celebration of Steve Prefontaine and his story more personal than in Coos Bay, Oregon, where he was born in 1951 and discovered his gift for running fast and far as a student at Marshfield High School,” event organizers posted on the event website. “Here, he developed his hunger to be the best in the field, and more, to do it with style—to create beauty when he ran, to show people something they had never seen before.”
