## Top 5 Oregon Coast Attractions -  
Indoors - For Kids of All Ages

[**Oregon’s Adventure Coast**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/)’s towns of Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston are known for their outdoor adventures – fishing, crabbing, clamming, hiking, biking, kayaking and more – but what do you do when the weather is less than cooperative and you have kids in tow?

### We have compiled our Top 5 Indoor Attractions here:

#### 1. Interact with Nature – Even Indoors

You can learn and interact with nature even when you’re not outside. The [**South Slough Estuary Reserve**]() has an amazing interpretive center, where you can look at fossils, learn about indigenous animals, and watch nature films. Visit their website to find out about programs and classes. The [**Charleston Marine Life Center**](http://www.charlestonmarinelifecenter.com/) is an oasis of marine learning and offers a touch tide pool, fossil displays, and live sea creature tanks. Come in and watch the fishing boats unload their catch from across the dock and spy a variety of bird species that call this part of the coast home.

#### 2. Museums

Museums are for kids too! [**The Coos History Museum**](https://cooshistory.org/), hosts Family fun Day on the first Saturday of each month – admission to the museum is **Free** to everyone all day long and there is a craft activity for kids from 10am-2pm. At the [**Coos Art Museum**](http://www.coosart.org/) rotating exhibits showcase local and national artists while the Prefontaine Gallery houses memorabilia and photographs depicting Steve Prefontaine’s running career and Olympic medals. Check the Coos Art Museum’s calendar for a variety of classes and activities for kids.

#### 3. Burn Off Some Energy

Need to really burn off some energy? Bowling is always fun – even if you’re not any good; and [**North Bend Lanes**](https://northbendlanes.com/) offers 14 lanes to accommodate parties of all sizes. Offering cosmic bowling, bumper bowling and a ball ramp means everyone can get in the game.  Head over to [**Outdoor In**](http://www.outdoor-in.com/), the indoor playground and bouncy house where kids can expend all that energy running, jumping and even playing a few video arcade games.

#### 4. Arcade Fun

Speaking of arcades, [**Joey’s Arcade**](https://www.facebook.com/Joeysarcade2.0/), a vintage arcade and soda bar, has everything from classic Pac Man to modern gaming systems, all for a flat fee entry. Located in the Pony Village Mall, means Mom & Dad may find other indoor activities to keep them busy, too.  Joey’s also offers a private party room.

#### 5. For the Little Artist

For your little artist, try out [**The Pottery Company**](https://www.facebook.com/The-Pottery-Co-161842183873942/) – paint your own pottery shop, [**Josie’s Art Lab**](https://www.josiesartlab.com/contact/), or [**The Making Place**]() to create their masterpieces.
