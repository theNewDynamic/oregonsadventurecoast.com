#### 1. Interact with Nature – Even Indoors

You can learn and interact with nature even when you’re not outside. The [**South Slough Estuary Reserve**]() has an amazing interpretive center, where you can look at fossils, learn about indigenous animals, and watch nature films. Visit their website to find out about programs and classes. The [**Charleston Marine Life Center**](http://www.charlestonmarinelifecenter.com/) is an oasis of marine learning and offers a touch tide pool, fossil displays, and live sea creature tanks. Come in and watch the fishing boats unload their catch from across the dock and spy a variety of bird species that call this part of the coast home.
