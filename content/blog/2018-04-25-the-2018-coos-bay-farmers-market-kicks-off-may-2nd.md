The Coos Bay Farmers Market is set to open its 18th season on Wednesday, May 2nd! The market operates every Wednesday from 9 AM to 2 PM through October 31st and is located in the heart of the Coos Bay downtown historic district on Central Ave. from Highway 101 across from the Coos Bay Visitors Center.



The CBFM presents over 60 vendors who provide the community with fresh, locally grown produce, eggs, honey, meat, baked goods, roasted coffee, flowers, body care products, and handmade craft items. We also feature local nonprofits, live music provided by So It Goes Coffeehouse, and a food court in front of the Hall Building.

Eating local is very budget-friendly at the farmers market, when buying items in their peak season. The Coos Bay Farmers Market accepts EBT, WIC, and the Farm Direct Nutrition Vouchers.



<a href="https://coosbaydowntown.org/farmers-market/">The Coos Bay Downtown Association (CBDA)</a> organizes the farmers market as a resource for the community to gain access to local vendors. It is also an opportunity to enjoy the floral background of hanging flower baskets that the CBDA membership provides. The fusion of market vendors and the downtown businesses near the Coos Bay Boardwalk creates an enjoyable ambiance making for a perfect day to shop, eat, mingle, and explore in downtown,

rain or shine.
