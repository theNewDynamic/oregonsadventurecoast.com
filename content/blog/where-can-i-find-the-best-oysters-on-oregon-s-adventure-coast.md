The 14th Annual Charleston “Ahh Shucks!” Oyster Feed, our annual celebration of fresh oysters, is coming up April 27th which got us thinking about where to find the very best oysters in the Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston area? We asked around and here’s what we found out.

**Ah Shucks! 14th Annual Charleston Oyster Feed**
If you are an oyster lover, the Ah Shucks! [14th Annual Charleston Oyster Feed](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/ah-shucks-14th-annual-charleston-oyster-feed/) is the place you need to be on April 27th.  This is a prime opportunity to taste delicious, fresh-from-Coos-Bay oysters provided by several of our local growers.

Oysters will be prepared in a variety of ways and will be served with dipping sauces, baked beans, coleslaw, garlic bread and a choice of beverages. Not a fan of oysters? No problem, there will also be options for you too. The event will also include live music, wine and plenty of fun.

**Local Growers**
If you can’t make it to this year’s oyster feed, not to worry. Some of the best oysters on the planet are harvested by local growers year round. Some of our finest local growers include  [Clausen's Silverpoint Oyster Co.](http://www.clausenoysters.com/), the largest oyster farm in the State of Oregon. [Clausen's](https://www.facebook.com/ClausenOysters/ ) is consistently recommended by locals for their fresh and shucked oysters as well as smoked oysters, BBQ Garlic-Parmesan Butter Oysters, Chowder and other delicious selections. Stop in to pick up fresh oysters to take home or stick around and enjoy a meal in their new deli/restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. You cannot miss their signs when you are driving North or South on Highway 101, North of North Bend and North of McCullough Bridge.

Another local oyster grower to put on your radar is [Qualman Oyster Farms in Charleston](https://www.yelp.com/biz/qualman-oyster-farms-coos-ba). One of the original oyster farms on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, Qualman’s grows their oysters in the South Slough sanctuary in immaculate and pristine conditions. Fans of Qualman’s say that they have the best oysters due to the quality of the water at the sanctuary which gives them an almost sweeter taste than oysters harvested from the bay. All oysters are hand grown, handpicked, local and reasonably priced.

Qualman Oyster Farms is located at 63218 Troller Rd. If you’re heading to Charleston on Cape Arago Highway, make a left just before the bridge. Other growers in town producing quality oysters include Coos Bay Oyster Co., North Bend Oyster Co., Pacific Choice in Charleston.

When asked “Who has the best oysters in town?” an overwhelming number of respondents recommended [Chuck’s Seafood](https://www.chucksseafood.com/ ), family-owned seafood market in Charleston, Oregon.  When visiting our area, a stop at this iconic market is a must for any seafood lover before heading home. Chucks is famous for its outstanding selection of freshly shucked oysters, and their smoked oysters like [Garlic-Pepper Smoked Coos Bay Oysters](https://www.chucksseafood.com/prepared-seafood/garlic-pepper-smoked-coos-bay-oysters-one-pound) are a favorite among locals and visitors alike.

**Restaurants**
If you’ve got a hankering for good oysters while you’re out and about, we have several restaurants in town that are likely to have a dish to satisfy your craving.
