Back in 1925, the world was abuzz with change and creativity. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby* had just hit bookshelves, the Chrysler Corporation was brand new, and a young jazz musician named Louis Armstrong was making his first recordings. And right here on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, another legend was being born: [The Egyptian Theatre](https://www.etpaoregon.org/) opened its doors on November 19, 1925, bringing a touch of Hollywood glamour and elegance to Marshfield, Oregon (officially renamed Coos Bay in 1945).

We are fortunate to have such an outstanding [network of cultural organizations](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/art-history-culture/) that enrich our community on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, but if classic cinema and entertainment in a historic venue sound appealing, then the Egyptian Theatre is a great destination to add to your Oregon Coast travel itinerary. With its ornate hieroglyphic décor, towering pharaoh statues, and a magnificent Wurlitzer organ still filling the theatre with music 100 years later, it’s an experience you won’t soon forget.

From its grand opening a century ago to its role as a beloved gathering place today, the Egyptian Theatre is more than a building, it’s a living piece of local history and a testament to our region’s endearing community spirit, hosting everything from silent films and “talkies” to concerts, fundraisers, comedy & magic shows, weddings, birthdays and more.

“November will mark a great milestone for the theatre,” says Egyptian Theatre Executive Director Jill Rasmusen. “On November 19, the theatre turns 100. On November 15, we will be celebrating just that. From a garage in 1923 -1925 to 100 years as a beautiful theatre right here in Coos County. I feel honored that I am the one leading this amazing milestone.”

In this post, we are celebrating 100 years of entertaining, inspiring, and connecting the community.

### **Mighty Wurlitzer Pipe Organ**

One of the Egyptian Theatre’s most treasured features is its <a href="https://www.etpaoregon.org/mighty-wurlitzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mighty Wurlitzer Pipe Organ</a>, a remarkable instrument that has been delighting audiences since 1925. Installed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company for $32,000, this Hope-Jones Unit Orchestra organ was designed to mimic the sound of a full orchestra—all played by a single musician. In many ways, it was the world’s first “synthesizer.”

Shipped to Coos Bay in more than 50 crates, the organ took three weeks to assemble. Thousands of pipes, large and small, were carefully installed in chambers on either side of the theatre behind the lyre players, where they remain today. Unlike a traditional church organ, the Wurlitzer features extras such as drums, castanets, cymbals, a slide whistle, and a marimba, bringing the spirit of the silent movie era to life.

Today, the Egyptian Theatre is home to the only original Wurlitzer pipe organ in Oregon still housed in its original location. This extraordinary instrument remains fully functional and continues to fill the theatre with music nearly a century later. During the summer months, visitors can even hear it played live on Wednesdays from noon to 1 p.m., a beloved tradition that keeps the magic of the Mighty Wurlitzer alive.

**Here are eight other fun facts you may not have known about the Egyptian Theatre.**

**Fun Fact \#1:** *Before it became the Egyptian Revival–style movie palace we know today, the Egyptian Theatre was a garage, and even briefly housed city hall and the jail.* Built in 1922 by Granstrom Contractors for H. Conje Noble and H. J. Clark, it originally operated as the Motor Inn Garage and Service Station. Just a few years later, in 1925, the building was transformed into a theatre, around the same time King Tutankhamen’s tomb was discovered. The world’s fascination with ancient Egypt inspired its dramatic new look, and the Egyptian Theatre was born.

**Fun Fact \#2:** *The Egyptian Theatre is one of only two original Egyptian-style theatres still standing on the West Coast, the other being Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.* At one time, more than 100 Egyptian-style theatres could be found across the country, but only a handful remain today, just seven in total. Beyond its rarity, Coos Bay’s Egyptian Theatre is considered one of the best-preserved examples of authentic Egyptian Revival architecture in the United States.

**Fun Fact \#3:** *The Theatre has changed ownership throughout the years, finally being purchased by the City of Coos Bay Urban Renewal Agency in 2006*. With the enlisted help of the nonprofit Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association, they have transformed the venue into a showcase for classic and educational movies, hosted concerts, special events, and community celebrations.

**Fun Fact \#4:** Inside, the theatre still showcases its original Egyptian-style décor, featuring ornate light fixtures, detailed finishes, hand-painted vaudeville flats, and a historic Wurlitzer pipe organ. Even the front door handles were designed to match the ceiling lights—a unique detail that dates all the way back to the theatre’s 1925 debut.

**Fun Fact \#5:** *The Egyptian Theatre earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 2010, a tribute to the community’s dedication to preserving this historic landmark.* After years of restoration, it proudly reopened in 2014, looking much like it did in its golden era. Inside the lobby, two bronze-colored, eight-foot-tall pharaoh statues, nicknamed “Foster” and “Stanley,” after the McSwain brothers who once owned the theatre, still stand guard on either side of the staircases. These regal figures have watched over moviegoers since the theatre first opened nearly a century ago.

**Fun Fact \#6:** *It is rumored to be haunted.* There are numerous ghost stories or legends connected to the building, including a “ghost” the staff refers to as Maggie, according to insiders.

**Fun Fact \#7:** *When the theatre reopened in 2014, volunteers noticed something odd: both of the pharaohs’ urns were missing*! Originally, “Foster” and “Stanley” each wore matching urns on their heads. Not long after, one of them was miraculously spotted at a garage sale and returned to its rightful place at the Egyptian. The other, however, remains missing to this day, a small mystery that continues to intrigue theatre fans and historians alike.

**Fun Fact \#8:** *The stage still features its original 1925 hardwood floor;* a remarkable piece of history that’s unexpectedly showing its age. Because much of Coos Bay was once marshland, the theatre was built on fill dirt. Over time, the back wall began to tilt outward, causing the stage floor to slope slightly toward it. Today, the back of the stage sits about 14 inches lower than the front, making it one of the Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association’s top restoration priorities.

### **Timeline of the last 100 Years**

**1922** – Originally built as the Motor Inn Garage and Service Station, designed by John Granstrom Construction Company. After World War I, federal building restrictions limited new construction, so the space was used for vehicles. However, plans were already forming to one day convert it into a movie palace. That same year, the discovery of King Tut’s tomb sparked America’s fascination with Egyptian design.

**1923–1924** – The City of Marshfield (now Coos Bay) leased part of the building to temporarily house the fire and police departments after a devastating fire destroyed City Hall.

**1925** – Restrictions lifted, and the Coos Bay Amusement Company (Robert Marsden Jr., John Noble, and Denny Hull) hired architect Lee Arden Thomas to transform the garage into an Egyptian Revival-style theatre.

Interior design by Carl F. Berg of the B.F. Shearer Company of Seattle. The Van Wie Scenery Company of Portland created hand-painted backdrops, which are still preserved today. A Wurlitzer Hope-Jones Unit Orchestra organ was installed, which is still in use today! Carl Berg, representative of the B.F. Shearer Company and expert in Egyptian design, was responsible for the decorations, furnishings, and artwork within the extensive interior décor. The Van Wie Scenery Company of Portland designed the curtains and six sets of hand-painted theatrical scenic drops, which are still suspended today in the fly loft above the stage.

**November 19, 1925 – Grand Opening Night!** Over 2,200 guests attended the opening celebrations, which lasted about a week. *Graustark* starring Norma Talmadge and Eugene O’Brien was the featured film and Rex Stratton played the pipe organ.

**1929** – The Egyptian introduces “talkies” (sound films), including George M. Cohan’s *The Home Towners* and *The Jazz Singer* starring Al Jolson.

**1930s–1940s** – Becomes the premier entertainment venue on Oregon’s South Coast. Hosts first-run films, community events, and “bank night” lotteries during the Depression. Known for its elegant décor and social atmosphere — the place to “see and be seen.”

**1949** – Sold to Jones Enterprises of California. Managed by Stan and Toni McSwain, who added a concession stand and new marquee while preserving the theatre’s Egyptian style.

**1960s** – The McSwains become owners and move the massive Egyptian columns to accommodate the new Cinemascope wide screen. 35mm film arrived in the 1960s. It was during the McSwain’s tenure in 1960 that Cinemascope came into being. To accommodate the large screen, Stan McSwain had the two massive Egyptian columns flanking the stage moved out to rest on massive plinths, retaining the integrity of the proscenium décor and enabling the showing of wide-screen movies.

**1976** – To adapt to declining attendance, the McSwains convert the balcony into “twin” mini theatres, allowing three films to play at once.

**1982–2005** – Ownership changes several times; maintenance declines. A nearby multiplex opens, leading to the Egyptian’s closure in November 2005.

**April 1, 2006** - The City of Coos Bay Urban Renewal Agency purchases the theatre. The Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association (ETPA) takes over operations, cleaning, restoring, and reopening it for community use. On July 21, 2006, the Agency signed a management agreement with the nonprofit [Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association](https://www.etpaoregon.org/)to allow the Association to manage and operate the theatre on behalf of the city and the community.

**2010** – Engineers discover structural issues; the theatre closes for significant repairs. Added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 2010.

**2011–2013** – ETPA and City of Coos Bay raise over $1 million for structural restoration and modernization.

**June 2014 – Grand Reopening!** The Egyptian reopens with upgraded roofing, drainage, electrical systems, ADA-accessible restrooms, and restored historic details.

Today, the Egyptian Theatre stands as one of only two original Egyptian-style movie palaces on the West Coast that are still operating, still enchanting audiences, and still proudly Coos Bay’s cultural crown jewel.

If you think you know everything there is to know about the Egyptian Theatre, think again. It has weathered the Great Depression, the Great Recession, a global pandemic, and adapted to changing times with new technology and renovations. It even survived a brief closure in the early 2000s before being lovingly restored by the Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association and the City of Coos Bay.
