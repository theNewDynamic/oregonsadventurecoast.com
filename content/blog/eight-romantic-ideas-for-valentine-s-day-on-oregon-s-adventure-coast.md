### 3) HUNT FOR TREASURES IN OUR UNIQUE SHOPPING DISTRICTS

Spend quality time together browsing through the unique shops in Downtown Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston. Together, you and your Valentine will delight in discovering eclectic gift shops, boutiques and delightful antique stores. Make sure you plan a stop to [Cranberry Sweets](http://cranberrysweets.com/), a candy manufacturer/retailer with stores in Bandon and Coos Bay. It’s a favorite among locals and visitors. We like them so much here at the visitor center, we set out a tray of samples that refills daily (or more often).

### 4) DINE AT ONE OF OUR FINE RESTAURANTS

The restaurants in Coos Bay\~North Bend\~Charleston are one of the best-kept secrets in our region!

This may surprise you, but February often brings gloriously warm and sunny days here on the Oregon Coast, perfect for a lovely walk on one of our [beautiful beaches](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/). WARNING: Never turn your back to the Ocean. Always watch for sneaker waves.

### 6) EXPERIENCE COAST CULTURE

We recommend a visit to the museums, galleries, and other cultural gems in our area like the [Coos History Museum](https://cooshistory.org/), Oregon’s oldest continuously operated historical society boasting more than 250,000 historic photographs, and the [Coos Art Museum (CAM](http://www.coosart.org/). CAM is the third oldest art museum in Oregon and it contains six galleries (over 5600 square feet) featuring anywhere between 12-25 changing original and touring exhibitions, and a 530 piece permanent collection. Don’t miss the Prefontaine Memorial Gallery on the 2nd floor, where you will find numerous photographs and tributes to this hometown hero.
