Much like the Salmon returns upstream, the <a href="http://www.themillcasino.com/entertainment/salmon.cfm" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration</a> returns each year to the Mill Casino in North Bend on **Friday, September 10th__ to **Sunday, September 11th, 2016. **

The annual Salmon Bake Dinner (ticketed event) is among the highlights of this celebration of Native American and <a href="http://www.coquilletribe.org/AboutUs.htm" target="_blank">Coquille Tribal culture</a>. The family-friendly event also offers visitors free daily performances by Native American storytellers, drummers, flutists and dancers, a marketplace offering traditional wares and foods, a bay-front canoe exhibit and races, traditional games and activities for children, plus a variety of cultural demonstrations and educational exhibits.

The celebration began as a means of sharing the heritage, culture and traditions of the [**Coquille Indian Tribe**](http://www.coquilletribe.org/) and other Pacific Northwest Tribes with residents and visitors to Oregon’s South Coast. Nowadays, the event attracts Native American artisans and musicians from throughout the Western United States and Canada.
