The celebration began as a means of sharing the heritage, culture and traditions of the **[Coquille Indian Tribe](http://www.coquilletribe.org/)** and other Pacific Northwest Tribes with residents and visitors to Oregon’s South Coast. Nowadays, the event attracts Native American artisans and musicians from throughout the Western United States and Canada.
