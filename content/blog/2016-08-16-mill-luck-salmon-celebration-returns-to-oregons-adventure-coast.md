Much like the Salmon returns upstream, the _Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration returns each year to the Mill Casino in North Bend on **Friday, September 10th__ to **Sunday, September 11th, 2016. **

The annual Salmon Bake Dinner (ticketed event) is among the highlights of this celebration of Native American and <a href="http://www.coquilletribe.org/AboutUs.htm" target="_blank">Coquille Tribal culture</a>. The family-friendly event also offers visitors free daily performances by Native American storytellers, drummers, flutists and dancers, a marketplace offering traditional wares and foods, a bay-front canoe exhibit and races, traditional games and activities for children, plus a variety of cultural demonstrations and educational exhibits.

The celebration began as a means of sharing the heritage, culture and traditions of the [**Coquille Indian Tribe**](http://www.coquilletribe.org/) and other Pacific Northwest Tribes with residents and visitors to Oregon’s South Coast. Nowadays, the event attracts Native American artisans and musicians from throughout the Western United States and Canada.

September’s a busy time in Coos Bay so we recommend booking accommodations before it’s too late! Visit our <a href="/lodging/" target="_blank">lodgings page </a>to search through great options of hotels and inns in the Coos Bay area.
