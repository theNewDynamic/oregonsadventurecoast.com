**Did you know?**&nbsp;One of the richest ecosystems and most bio-diverse destinations on the Oregon Coast is right in our own backyard? The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR) is among the most precious natural habitats on the Oregon coast. You’ve heard us say that **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** is where the land meets the bay and the sea; estuaries like SSNERR are where rivers meet the sea.&nbsp;

In general, many people do not know the impact that estuaries have on our ecosystem and daily lives until they visit one. Estuaries such as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/ss/pages/about.aspx">South Slough</a> are vital to our way of life for the following reasons:&nbsp;

* They help to mitigate the devastating impacts of flooding by acting as a natural barrier against storms, while also absorbing and storing carbon.&nbsp;

* They provide essential habitats for both commercial and recreational fisheries.&nbsp;

* They enhance water quality by effectively filtering out sediment and pollutants.

* They are nurturing grounds for a diverse array of species, including various fish, shellfish, and invertebrates. Basically, South Slough is a nursery for our dungeness crab, salmon, herring, oystersand other fish species!
