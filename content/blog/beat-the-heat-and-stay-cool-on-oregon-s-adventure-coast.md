### BEAT THE HEAT AND STAY COOL ON OREGON’S ADVENTURE COAST

When the mercury starts to rise, land-locked Oregonians’ thoughts turn to the coast, where the Pacific Ocean (aka, “Nature’s Air Conditioner”) serves up plenty of cool breezes and fresh air. **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston** is known for being cool, literally. Yes, there are scores of “cool” [activities](/adventures/) the whole family can enjoy, but with an average summertime temperature of mid-high 60s, our region offers a blissful escape from scorching hot temperatures you might be experiencing in other parts of the state this time of year.

If you’re planning your next “beat the heat” trip to the coast, **Oregon’s Adventure Coast** is just a couple hours from Eugene, through the beautiful Coast Range, and offers those cooler temps you crave and something else too — space to spread out. With miles of undeveloped beaches, the longest stretch of coastal dunes in North America, and some of the Oregon Coast’s most jaw-droppingly beautiful hikes, there’s just more room to explore here.

#### A Summer Getaway You Won’t Soon Forget

One thing’s for sure. You won’t run out of things to do on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

Book an adrenaline-charged [ATV or dune buggy trip](/atv-motorsports/) in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Let the cliff-lined Pacific inspire you as you hike along the 6.5-mile trail that connects the majestic [Sunset Bay, Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks](/hiking-walking/). Or head east into the Coast Range to visit [two of Oregon's most iconic waterfalls](/hiking-walking/).

**Oregon’s Adventure Coast** also offers a wealth of options for [fishing](/fishing/), [crabbing](/crabbing-clamming/), [clamming](/clamming/), [mountain biking](/cycling/), and [birding](/birding-and-wildlife/). Guided [kayaking, ATVing and fishing tours](/blog/where-to-find-local-tour-guides-charters-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) are available to help the whole family enjoy the area to its fullest.

{{< spacer 20 >}}

#### [**Combine the Cape Arago Hwy Loop & Charleston to Bandon Tour for the Ultimate Oregon Coast Road Trip**](/blog/featured-road-trip-cape-arago-highway-charleston-to-bandon-tour-route/)

This 41-mile route features everything you could hope to see along the Oregon Coast — iconic views of the Pacific ocean, marine life, sea lions and seabirds, untouched beaches, secret coves, six state parks, two National Wildlife Refuges and America’s first National Estuarine Research Reserve.

#### [**Get "Beachy" at Bastendorff Beach**](/blog/2017-08-29-spotlight-on-bastendorff-beach/)

We love all of our beautiful, undeveloped beaches here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. But [Bastendorff Beach](/undeveloped-beaches/), about two miles west of Charleston, seems to be a fan favorite. It’s never overly crowded and makes you feel as if you’ve entered a different world, even though you’re only minutes from town. The beach is ideal for picnicking, walking/jogging, or just spending a relaxing day perched on a beach chair gazing at the sea. It’s a favorite among surfers, kiters, campers, beachcombers, and locals and tourists alike. Visitors going to the beach should be aware of [coastal safety hazards](/blog/eight-ways-to-stay-safe-on-the-beaches-along-the-oregon-coast/) with the potential danger of undertows, sneaker waves, and rolling logs.

#### [**Surf On!**](/water-recreation/)

There’s a reason why surfers love Oregon’s Adventure Coast! We could explain, but we’d rather show you in this video our friend Rick Dancer shared when he experienced Surfing Oregon’s Adventure Coast style!
