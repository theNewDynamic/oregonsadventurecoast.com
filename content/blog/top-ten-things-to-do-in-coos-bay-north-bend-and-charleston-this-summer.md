Without question, summer is one of our favorite seasons on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**. What makes summer so special here? Maybe it’s that distinct, laid-back, Oregon Coast vibe that’s especially palpable in the summer. Or, it could be escaping the heat and enjoying some blissfully cool, comfortable temperatures that average in the mid-high 60s. Perhaps it's the lively summer-time events and festivals that make our region so special. Or, it might be the natural beauty that radiates from the beautiful Pacific Ocean, bays, lakes, rivers and coastal forests that lure travelers here from all over the country.&nbsp;
