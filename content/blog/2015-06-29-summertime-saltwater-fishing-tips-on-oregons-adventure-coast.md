## There are plenty of fish in the sea!

You may have heard, but fishing is in no short supply here on Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast. It&#8217;s no wonder, since Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston has a bounty of incredible fishing options! Summer is the perfect time to go <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay/" target="_blank">saltwater fishing</a> on the beach and/or in the Pacific Ocean. In fact, saltwater fishing is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities during this time of year.

Thanks to the many charter boat companies in this area, fishermen of all levels can venture offshore for salmon, halibut, Albacore tuna and a variety of bottomfish – from lingcod, to rockfish, to flatfish. Charter boat operators can help plan half-day and full-day trips for any size group. Here is a list of some of our local companies to get you started:

If casting your line from shore sounds more appealing, you can choose from a number of locations for <a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/docs/ODFWOutdoorsSurfPerchFlyerFinal.pdf " target="_blank">surf fishing</a> including Horsfall Beach, Bastendorff Beach and Cape Arago State Park where anglers can find striped bass and surf perch. Please note, whenever surf fishing, consult tidal charts, weather conditions and beware that sneaker waves occur on the Oregon Coast.

## Remember to NEVER turn your back on the ocean.

## Gary Vonderohe&#8217;s Saltwater Fishing Tips

When it comes to current conditions, seasonal tips and catch limits, Gary Vonderohe is the person we turn to.

A Fish Biologist with the  <a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/" target="_blank">Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife </a>in Charleston, Gary knows where fishermen can go to find the best saltwater fishing options this summer and wants to pass on his tips to you.

### Salmon Fishing

Most Pacific salmon fishing occurs April through November, and sport seasons are regulated for Coho and Chinook salmon by state and federal agencies.Gary says that Chinook salmon fishing in the ocean has been open since March 15th, but it has been slow so far this year but will hopefully pick up in July and August. The Selective Coho (fin-clipped) season opened on June 27th and will run through the earlier part of August or when the the 55,000 coho quota if filled. Fishing for fin-clipped coho is usually better in the Coos Bay area early in the season (so now is prime time).

### Halibut Fishing

The Nearshore Halibut season (inside 40-fathom line) will open on July 1st and will continue through October 31st or when the quota of 21,076 pounds is fulfilled. The Summer All-depth Halibut season will begin on August 7-8.

### Albacore Tuna

Albacore Tuna tend to be offshore from mid summer through early fall. A few Albacore Tuna have already been caught offshore. Fishing for Albacore Tuna has typically been best in late July, August, and sometimes into September but anglers travel 20-30 miles offshore to find the best fishing.

### Bottomfish

Bottomfish are available year around – weather permitting – and a charter trip usually ends with an ice chest full of fish. Fishing for bottomfish like black rockfish and lingcod has been good all spring and into the early part of summer, but it&#8217;s now restricted to inside the 30-fathom line until the end of September. Since there have been numerous changes, Gary recommends checking with the <a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/RR/southwest/" target="_blank">Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife </a> for the most up to date recreation report for bottomfish catch limits.

### Crabbing

Crabbing inside Coos Bay has been good so far this year with boat crabbers having the most success. If you don’t have a boat there are lots of docks in Charleston to drop you crab pots from. Crabbing is typically best on either side of the slack tides.

### Clamming

The South Oregon coast, home to numerous bays, is the ideal destination for recreational diggers and we expect tides to be ideal for clamming well into summer and even fall! Clamming for bay clams in Coos Bay is open and is always good on just about any low tide. Razor clamming has been closed along the entire Oregon Coast due to elevated levels of domoic acid.

Now that you&#8217;re in the know, let&#8217;s help you plan your summer fishing trip to Coos Bay!
