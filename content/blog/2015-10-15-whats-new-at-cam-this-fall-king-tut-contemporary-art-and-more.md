  We believe that one of the best kept secrets on Oregon's South Coast is the
  Coos Art Museum (CAM). Through collections, exhibitions and educational
  programs, CAM is building a robust arts and cultural scene in our community
  while promoting the appreciation, understanding and expression of visual arts.

We believe that one of the best kept secrets on Oregon&#8217;s South Coast is the <a href="http://www.coosart.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Coos Art Museum (CAM)</strong></a>. Through collections, exhibitions and educational programs, CAM is building a robust arts and cultural scene in our community while promoting the appreciation, understanding and expression of visual arts.

Here&#8217;s a tip: When you go, plan to stay a while. The museum contains over 5600 square feet of space and has multiple galleries including the famed Prefontaine Gallery on the 2nd floor.

The art museum, housed in a historical art deco structure built in 1936, has been a vital part of the state’s cultural landscape for nearly 50 years and continue to challenge and educate the public with extraordinary exhibits this fall. Here are some of the current exhibits we hope you will go see this Fall.

As part of the A Sense of Place exhibition and Coos Art Museum’s Fall Lecture Series, Coos Bay Mayor Crystal Shoji will lead a town hall meeting and artists’ feedback forum on Thursday, November 5, 2015 from 5:30 to 6:30p.m.
