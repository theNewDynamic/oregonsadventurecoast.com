## _Enter to win a Whiskey Run Mountain Biking Adventure with lodging, beer tasting, dinner, an expert tour with local guides, a fun pack and more!_

[Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trails](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/whiskey-run-pocket-map-06-22-final.pdf), a one-of-a-kind trail system winding through the misty Coos County Forest, is renowned for its moderate climbing and fun descending. It’s not only one of the most prized biking trails in our region, it is one of the few in the state of Oregon that are open year-round! Unlike other biking systems in Oregon, its 32 miles of single-track trails are ideal for beginner, intermediate, and advanced riders. Riders are treated to sweeping views, tranquil streams, and fern covered forest floors that can only be experienced on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston. Take a look!
