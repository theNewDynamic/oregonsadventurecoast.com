**COOS BAY, OR (April 2025)** — Oregon's Adventure Coast is about to become even more accessible for Colorado travelers. United Airlines has announced nonstop flights between Denver International Airport (DEN) and Southwest Oregon Regional Airport (OTH) in North Bend, Oregon, will begin on May 22nd and run daily through October 25, 2025.

This seasonal service offers an unmatched convenience for adventure-minded travelers looking to explore Oregon's rugged coastlines, undeveloped beaches, and local communities without the hassle of long car rides from larger airports. "We’re thrilled to welcome this direct connection from Denver," said Janice Langlinais, Executive Director of the Coos Bay-North Bend-Charleston Visitor & Convention Bureau. "Oregon’s Adventure Coast is a natural fit for Coloradans, and summer is a great time to visit. The weather here is nice and cool while much of the country is sweltering, not to mention the region is alive with fishing, hiking, mountain biking, surfing, swimming, festivals, fresh seafood and so much more."

Located just minutes from downtown North Bend and Coos Bay, Southwest Oregon Regional Airport (OTH) is the only commercial airport on the Oregon Coast offering passenger airline service. The airport’s location makes it a gateway to some of the Pacific Northwest’s most iconic outdoor experiences, from Oregon Coast hiking trails and kayaking to world-class mountain biking, ATV rides in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, deep-sea charter fishing, clamming, crabbing, and more. With direct access to the southern Oregon coast, visitors can go from their airplane seat to adventure in minutes.
