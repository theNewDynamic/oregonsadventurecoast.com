***Cape Arago Highway (Oregon Route 540) Closure: What It Means for Visitors to Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks...for Now.***

The [state parks](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) and [undeveloped beaches](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) along the [Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) are among the most cherished destinations on the Oregon Coast. Known for their scenic trails, beaches, and wildlife, including seals and sea lions, these parks showcase the true beauty of Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston.

By now, you probably have heard about the extreme flooding and the small landslide in early January that damaged a section of the Cape Arago Beach Loop, temporarily limiting vehicle access to [Shore Acres](https://shoreacres.net/) and [Cape Arago State Parks](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=66). In this post, we’ll share the latest updates, answer common questions, and suggest alternatives for enjoying these beautiful state parks on Oregon’s South Coast this winter. Here is what we know so far:

* On January 3, 2025, heavy rain and flooding caused a landslide that undercut a section of Cape Arago Highway (Oregon Route 540) near Norton’s Gulch, between Sunset Bay State Park and Shore Acres State Park.
* The landslide caused significant roadway damage but fortunately resulted in no injuries.
* Oregon Route 540 is temporarily closed to vehicle traffic, cutting off vehicle access to Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks. The road closure is past the entrances to both the Sunset Bay Campground and the Sunset Bay Golf Course.
* The Sunset Bay State Park day-use area remains open and accessible by vehicle, unaffected by the landslide. While the campground initially closed due to flooding, it has since reopened to campers, though availability may change with weather conditions.
* The [Oregon Parks and Recreation Department](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/pages/index.aspx) (OPRD) is working with contractors and engineers to assess the damage and determine repair timelines for Cape Arago Loop. No estimated completion date is available yet.
* [Hiking trails](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking/) along Cape Arago Highway, including a portion of the Oregon Coast Trail, remain open and safe for use. Visitors can access Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks via these trails.

OPRD spokesperson Lee Ricci emphasizes the importance of keeping visitors informed about potential risks while encouraging safe access to the parks. Below, we address some of the most common questions regarding the road closure and its impact on the trails, beaches, and state parks along the Cape Arago Beach Loop. Here are some answers to some of your questions:

**Is the entire Cape Arago Highway loop closed?** No, only the section south of Sunset Bay State Park leading to Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks is closed. The following destinations remain open and accessible by vehicle:

* [Charleston Marine Life Center](https://cmlc.uoregon.edu/)
* [Charleston Marina](https://www.portofcoosbay.com/charleston-marina)
* [Bastendorff Beach](https://www.blm.gov/visit/bastendorff-beach)
* [Sunset Bay State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=70)
* [Sunset Bay Golf Course](https://www.sunsetbaygolf.net/)

**How long will this section be closed?** OPRD does not have an estimate on how long it will take to repair that section of Cape Arago Highway.. We do not have an official ETA for when the road will be reopened to the public, but we will post through our official channels when we have that information.

**Are the state parks open?** Yes, [all state parks on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) are currently open. However, Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks are inaccessible by car and can only be reached by hiking a section of the Oregon Coast Trail, as mentioned above.

**Can I go camping in the Sunset State Park campground?** Yes, the [Sunset Bay State Park campground](https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/camping/sunset-bay-state-park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=OR&amp;parkId=402382)has reopened after a temporary closure due to heavy rain and flooding. However, conditions are subject to change, so visitors should check with Oregon State Parks or call the reservation line for updates.

**Are the trails from the parking lots at Sunset Bay open?** Yes, the trails are open and in surprisingly good condition despite the recent heavy rain and flooding.

**What about bathrooms?** Bathrooms at Sunset Bay are open during their usual hours. At Shore Acres, the restrooms, garden area, and gift center are closed, but portable toilets are available for thru-hikers.

**Can I access Shore Acres or Cape Arago by bike?** No, the road is closed to all traffic, including bicycles and motorbikes. The only way to reach these state parks is by hiking, and bikes are not permitted on the trails.

**Is it safe to walk or run on Cape Arago Highway now that cars are not allowed south of Sunset Bay?** While some pedestrians use Cape Arago Highway, Park Manager Lee Ricci advises against it. Park rangers still use the road, so some traffic is present. **Important!! Avoid the slide area marked with cones.** The slide has a significant overhang, with sections of asphalt unsupported underneath. For your safety, keep a distance from the edge, stay alert for official vehicles working on road repairs, and avoid all traffic cones.

**What Are My Options Now That Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks Are Not Accessible by Vehicle? ​​**If you’re looking for alternatives to access these parks, hiking the [Oregon Coast Trail](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/ckFiles/files/OCT-Map-7.pdf) (Sunset Bay to Cape Arago) is your best option. This invigorating hike is accessible for most skill levels and offers panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean and other highlights of the Cape Arago Highway. From Sunset Bay State Park, the distance is a manageable 1.5 miles to Shore Acres (3 miles round trip) or 3.25 miles to Cape Arago (6.5 miles round trip).

**Some Things to Note:**

* Hikers may access the OCT trailhead leading to Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks from the second parking lot of the Sunset Bay State Park day-use area.
* A small portion of the hike requires a brief road walk (near Norton’s Gulch)—use extreme caution and promptly return to the trail.
* **Please do not touch or disturb the wildlife under any circumstances!**
* Stay on designated trails to avoid further damage to the landscape and [follow Leave No Trace principles](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/leave-no-trace-7-guidelines-to-protect-oregon-s-adventure-coast-for-future-visitors/).
* **Pro Tip:** Bring binoculars to enhance your experience. You’ll have excellent chances to spot sea lions, harbor seals, migrating whales, and seabirds from various viewpoints along the trail.

**What About Storm-Watching?** If you want to view the high surf and dramatic waves from Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks, you will have to walk there via the OCT from Sunset Bay State Park as mentioned above. However, hikers should exercise extreme caution. Emergency services may have difficulty reaching these areas due to road closures, so travel at your own risk. For your safety, stay on marked trails, avoid cliffs and unmarked areas, and keep a distance from the water. Bring a buddy, inform someone of your plans, and share your expected return time.

For easier access by vehicle, consider these alternative storm-watching locations:

* **Bastendorff Beach Bluff**: Offers fantastic views of the ocean from a safe, elevated location.
* **Sunset Bay State Park**: A convenient spot for wave-watching near the day-use parking area.

**\*\*Safety Tips for Storm Watching during High Surf Events\*\***

* Stay on marked trails and avoid getting too close to cliffs or beaches.
* Stay away from the water and from logs.
* Stay off the Jetties.
* Always keep the ocean in view and never turn your back to it.
* Monitor news reports and posted warnings.
* Know your escape route in case of rising water.
* Avoid standing near cliffs.
* Always watch for sneaker waves and unstable ground, especially near cliffs.
* Dress warmly and bring waterproof gear to stay comfortable in the elements.

**Can I Take My Dog?** Yes, hikers with dogs can use the Oregon Coast Trail section that runs from Sunset Bay State Park to Cape Arago State Park, passing through Shore Acres State Park. However, dogs must remain on the trail or in the parking lot area only. Dogs are not permitted near the Observation Building, bathroom areas, or within the gardens (currently closed).
