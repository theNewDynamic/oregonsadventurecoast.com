***UPDATED February 10, 2025:** Cape Arago Highway (Oregon Route 540) has been repaired and is now open to all vehicle traffic! All State Parks and hiking trails impacted by the damage in early January and are open to the public and accessible by vehicle.*

**Cape Arago Highway (Oregon Route 540) Closure: What It Means for Visitors to Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks...for Now.**

The [state parks](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) and [undeveloped beaches](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) along the [Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) are among the most cherished destinations on the Oregon Coast. Known for their scenic trails, beaches, and wildlife, including seals and sea lions, these parks showcase the true beauty of **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston**.

By now, you probably have heard about the extreme flooding and the small landslide in early January that damaged a section of the Cape Arago Beach Loop, temporarily limiting vehicle access to [Shore Acres](https://shoreacres.net/) and [Cape Arago State Parks](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=66). In this post, we’ll share the latest updates, answer common questions, and suggest alternatives for enjoying these beautiful state parks on Oregon’s South Coast this winter.

Here is what we know so far:

* On January 3, 2025, heavy rain and flooding caused a landslide that undercut a section of Cape Arago Highway (Oregon Route 540) near Norton’s Gulch, between Sunset Bay State Park and Shore Acres State Park.
* The landslide caused significant roadway damage but fortunately resulted in no injuries.
* Oregon Route 540 is temporarily closed to vehicle traffic, cutting off vehicle access to Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks. The road closure is past the entrances to both the Sunset Bay Campground and the Sunset Bay Golf Course.
* The Sunset Bay State Park day-use area remains open and accessible by vehicle, unaffected by the landslide. While the campground initially closed due to flooding, it has since reopened to campers, though availability may change with weather conditions.
* The [Oregon Parks and Recreation Department](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/pages/index.aspx) (OPRD) is working with contractors and engineers to assess the damage and determine repair timelines for Cape Arago Loop. No estimated completion date is available yet.
* [Hiking trails](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking/) along Cape Arago Highway, including a portion of the Oregon Coast Trail, remain open and safe for use. Visitors will still be able to access the Bog Trail between the campground and Yoakam Point, the day-use areas of Sunset Bay, and the portion of the Oregon Coast Trail (OCT) that goes from South Sunset Bay Day Use to Norton Gulch.

OPRD spokesperson Lee Ricci emphasizes the importance of keeping visitors informed about potential risks while encouraging safe access to the parks. Below, we address some of the most common questions regarding the road closure and its impact on the trails, beaches, and state parks along the Cape Arago Beach Loop. Here are some answers to some of your questions:

**Is the entire Cape Arago Highway loop closed?** No, only the section south of Sunset Bay State Park leading to Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks is closed. The following destinations remain open and accessible by vehicle:

* [Charleston Marine Life Center](https://cmlc.uoregon.edu/)
* [Charleston Marina](https://www.portofcoosbay.com/charleston-marina)
* [Bastendorff Beach](https://www.blm.gov/visit/bastendorff-beach)
* [Sunset Bay State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=70)
* [Sunset Bay Golf Course](https://www.sunsetbaygolf.net/)

**How long will this section be closed?** Repair work has begun, but OPRD does not have an official ETA for when the road will be reopened to the public. We will share that information through our official channels when we know something.

**Are the state parks open?** Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks are currently inaccessible, but [all other state parks and national lands on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) are open.

**Can I go camping in the Sunset State Park campground?** Yes, the [Sunset Bay State Park campground](https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/camping/sunset-bay-state-park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=OR&amp;parkId=402382)has reopened after a temporary closure due to heavy rain and flooding. However, conditions are subject to change, so visitors should check with Oregon State Parks or call the reservation line for updates.

**Are the trails from the parking lots at Sunset Bay open?** Yes, the trails are open and in surprisingly good condition despite the recent heavy rain and flooding. For an abbreviated exploration of the Oregon Coast Trail, take the 2.25 mile round trip hike from <a href="https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;amp;parkId=70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunset Bay State Park</a> day use area to Norton Gulch and back. There are plenty of interesting coves to explore along the trail.

**What about bathrooms?** Bathrooms at Sunset Bay are open during their usual hours. At Shore Acres, the restrooms, garden area, and gift center are closed, but portable toilets are available for thru-hikers.

**Can I access Shore Acres or Cape Arago by foot or bike?** No, the road is closed to all vehicle, bike, and foot traffic.

**What About Storm-Watching?** If you want to view the high surf and dramatic waves from Shore Acres and Cape Arago State Parks, you will have to walk there via the OCT from Sunset Bay State Park as mentioned above. However, hikers should exercise extreme caution. Emergency services may have difficulty reaching these areas due to road closures, so travel at your own risk. For your safety, stay on marked trails, avoid cliffs and unmarked areas, and keep a distance from the water. Bring a buddy, inform someone of your plans, and share your expected return time.

For easier access by vehicle, consider these alternative storm-watching locations:

* **Bastendorff Beach Bluff**: Offers fantastic views of the ocean from a safe, elevated location.
* **Sunset Bay State Park**: A convenient spot for wave-watching near the day-use parking area.

#### **\*\*Safety Tips for Storm Watching during High Surf Events\*\***
