Oregon’s Adventure Coast is deeply enriched by its Indigenous heritage, which has shaped the region for thousands of years. Long before European settlers arrived, Native communities thrived along the southern Oregon Coast, fishing, hunting, and gathering in harmony with the land. November is National Native American Heritage Month, an ideal time to honor the culture, ingenuity, and resilience of these tribes, including the [Coquille Indian Tribe](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tribal-heritage-coquilles/) and the [Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tribal-heritage-confederated/). It’s also a chance to learn more about their lasting impact and significant contributions made socially, economically and culturally on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston, and Southwest Oregon.

## Coquille Indian Tribe

The Coquille Indian Tribe's ancestors thrived in Southwestern Oregon, occupying over one million acres. The 1989 Coquille Restoration Act reestablished the Tribe’s sovereignty, and by 1996, they resumed stewardship of 5,410 acres of ancestral land. Today, nearly 1,200 members manage approximately 10,000 acres of sustainable forest.

**Economic Impact of the Coquille Indian Tribe**<br>As the second-largest employer in Coos County, the Coquille Indian Tribe drives significant economic growth throughout the South Coast community. Through various ventures in hospitality, forestry, healthcare, construction, and more, the Tribe generates $20 million annually in local salaries and benefits, per information provided in 2018. Additionally, their expanding network of enterprises injects millions into the local economy, supporting local businesses and contributing to the vitality of the region.

**Potlatch Tradition**<br>The Coquille Indian Tribe proudly upholds the [Potlatch tradition](https://www.coquilletribe.org/potlatch2/), using its resources to benefit the entire community. "Potlatch" refers to the longstanding practice of gift-giving among Indigenous Tribes of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Guided by the unofficial motto, “Take what you need and leave some for the others,” the Tribe reinvests its profits and revenue to support education, healthcare, and elder services for both tribal members and non-members. As a Potlatch tribe, the Coquille Indians embrace the spirit of generosity and joyfully share with their neighbors.

**Coquille Tribal Community Fund**<br>[The Coquille Tribal Community Fund](https://www.coquilletribe.org/3-30-coquille-tribal-community-fund/) is committed to supporting organizations that make a lasting impact in the community. Since its inception in 2001, the fund has distributed more than $8.7 million to local nonprofits, including food pantries, homeless programs, music initiatives, museums, community centers, veterans groups, and children's services. Established by the Coquille Tribal Council to share profits from The Mill Casino • Hotel and other ventures, the fund focuses on projects that improve daily life in the Coos Bay area and southwestern Oregon.

Grants emphasize key areas: education, public safety, arts and culture, environment, historic preservation, health, and problem gambling prevention. The fund accepts grant applications each fall. Learn more at [<u>www.coquilletribe.org</u>](http://www.coquilletribe.org).

**Ko-Kwel Wellness Center**<br>The Coquille Indian Tribe also invests its resources in the Ko-Kwel Wellness Center, which serves Coquille Tribal families, members of other American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, Coquille Tribal employees, and the general public as capacity allows. With locations in Coos Bay and Eugene, the center provides a holistic approach to healing in a welcoming, inclusive environment. The Coquille Indian Tribe Pharmacy is located within the Ko-Kwel Wellness Center in Coos Bay, which also offers mental health services and a full-service dental clinic.

## Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians

The Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians (CTCLUSI) are dedicated to promoting health and wellness among their Tribal families and the wider community. The names of the three major rivers in their region—Coos, Umpqua, and Siuslaw—are a testament to the rich heritage of the Tribes, as are many local lakes. Their original territory consisted of nearly 2 million acres of shorelines, rivers, lakes, estuaries and mixed forests. In 1954, the Tribes were stripped of their federal recognition, but after three decades of relentless efforts, they successfully regained their sovereign status on October 17, 1984. This historic day is honored annually with a remembrance hike and a community meal, celebrating the Tribes' resilience and enduring cultural legacy.

**The Three Rivers Foundation**<br>The Three Rivers Foundation, established in 2011 as the charitable giving arm of the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians and Three Rivers Casino and Hotel, is dedicated to enhancing the well-being of Southwest Oregon’s land and people. Reflecting the Tribe's culture and values, the foundation invests in community-driven initiatives across healthcare, education, public safety, environmental preservation, and more. This year, the foundation awarded more than $720,000 to 95 nonprofit organizations across Oregon, including first-time grant recipients like the North Bend Police Department, which will use funds for essential emergency response equipment. With a commitment to supporting impactful and innovative projects, the Three Rivers Foundation continues to invite applications annually, funding efforts that uplift the community and preserve the interconnectedness of land and people. Learn more at [ThreeRiversFoundation.org](https://www.threeriversfoundation.org/about).

**Three Rivers Health Center**<br>Last summer, CTCLUSI celebrated the opening of the [Three Rivers Health Center](https://threerivers.health/locations/coos-bay-oregon/three-rivers-health-center-coos-bay/) in Coos Bay, Oregon—a groundbreaking model for integrated care that nurtures the body, mind, and spirit. This state-of-the-art facility offers comprehensive, multidimensional healthcare services, welcoming CTCLUSI tribal members, members of all federally recognized tribes, and non-tribal community members across Southwest Oregon. In addition to the health center, the tribe has also launched a pharmacy and the [Three Rivers Dental Clinic – Coos Bay](https://threerivers.health/locations/coos-bay-oregon/three-rivers-dental-clinic-coos-bay/), further expanding access to holistic and high-quality healthcare for the community.

From practicing Potlatch traditions to investing in healthcare and education, the Coquille Indian Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians have shown remarkable resilience and continue to enrich the community through stewardship, economic contributions, and charitable initiatives. As we celebrate National Native American Heritage Month, it’s a meaningful time to reflect on and honor the enduring influence and generosity of our Native communities.
