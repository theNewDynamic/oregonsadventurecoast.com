To truly experience Oregon’s Adventure Coast from local’s point of view, you simply have to get out on the water. There is a range of recreational water activities to choose from here on Oregon’s South Coast. Everything from kayaking to paddleboarding, swimming, scuba diving, surfing and fishing on lakes or with a [guide or charter company](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/tour-guides-and-charters/).

* A unique view of the tug boats, lumber barges, wood chip ships, and a Coast Guard Cutter.
* A close-up view of Coos Bay’s estuary system. 
* A trip under the iconic Conde McCullough Bridge.

> _"We went on a two hour tour and the boat ride was very smooth and excellent. The Captain and the Shipmate are truly friendly and down to earth people with a great sense of humor. The captain followed the tall pirate ships as they fired there cannons and stayed close to the pirate ship and we were able to take excellent pictures and video. Thank you for making this a wonderful memory for our family from Chicago & Cottage Grove."_ - Tammy A. Facebook
