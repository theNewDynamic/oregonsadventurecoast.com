**\#1** [Simpson Reef and Shell Island Wildlife Viewing](https://shoreacres.net/about-us/simpson-reef-and-shell-island/) - While Shore Acres State Park is popular, fewer people venture to the Simpson Reef Overlook, where the road less traveled offers exceptional opportunities to view seals, sea lions, and even whales. It’s a peaceful spot perfect for wildlife lovers and nature photographers.

**\#2 Lunch at** [Monkey Business Marina Market & Restaurant in the Charleston Marina](https://www.facebook.com/MonkeyBusinessFoodToGo/)\- This local favorite is loved for its mouthwatering burgers, fresh seafood, and award-winning tacos.

**\#3** [The Wurlitzer Organ in the Egyptian Theatre](https://www.etpaoregon.org/mighty-wurlitzer) - Built in 1925, the historic [Egyptian Theatre](https://www.egyptiantheatre.events/) in downtown Coos Bay is the largest of its kind on the Oregon Coast. Beloved by locals, it hosts classic films, live performances, and special events. One of its standout features is the original 1925 Wurlitzer Hope-Jones Unit Orchestra organ, which remains fully operable. Visitors can experience its powerful, beautiful music during special events, holiday concerts, and performances during the Coos Bay Wednesday Farmer’s Market.

**\#4** [Hiking the Millicoma Marsh Trail](https://coostrails.com/millacoma-marsh/) **\-** Just a short drive from downtown Coos Bay, the Millicoma Marsh Trail features a 1.5-mile loop through wetland habitats, perfect for nature walks and birdwatching. Loved for its scenic views and excellent wildlife spotting—like Red-shouldered Hawks and Northern Shrikes—this quiet trail has well-maintained, flat paths and interpretive panels highlighting the area’s ecosystem and history, making it a hidden gem on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

**\#5 Coffee & Baked Treats at** [Ladybread Bakery in Coos Bay](https://theladybreadbakery.com/)  - Ladybread Bakery is a beloved artisan bakery in the Coos Bay area, known for its handcrafted breads available at specialty markets and farmers' markets.

**\#6** [The Oregon Merci Train Car](http://mercitrain.org/Oregon/)\- Restored and celebrated for its 75th anniversary in 2024, the Oregon Merci Train Car in North Bend is a unique piece of American history, symbolizing France's gratitude to the United States after World War II. One of 49 boxcars sent in 1949, this "forty and eight" model, used in both World Wars, is a tangible link to international friendship.

**\#7 The Back Patio at** [North Forty Brewing in North Bend](https://www.northfortybeer.com/) - North Forty Brewing in North Bend is quickly becoming a favorite for its craft beer and delicious local menu, featuring highlights like the steak and frites sandwich.
