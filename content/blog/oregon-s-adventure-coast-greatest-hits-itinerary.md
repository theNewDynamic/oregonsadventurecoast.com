Keep reading for an itinerary featuring some of our “Greatest Hits” on Oregon’s Adventure Coast that every first-time (or second, third, fourth time) visitor should experience...but first, here are some rules to keep in mind:

* Please do not touch or bother any wildlife or seal pups you may find on beaches. We promise, they are not lost, only waiting for mom to return.
* Plan ahead and make restaurant reservations ahead of time, or be prepared to wait. Download and print our newest [Dining Guide](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/img/restaurants-booklet.pdf) to take with you.
* Stay safe when you are near the water, and NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO THE OCEAN! Read [Eight Ways To Stay Safe On The Beaches Along The Oregon Coast.](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/eight-ways-to-stay-safe-on-the-beaches-along-the-oregon-coast/)

{{< spacer 50 >}}

## Day One: Ride the Oregon Dunes, Taste the World’s Most Delicious Oysters, and Win Big at the Casino!

Day one is full of adventure – outdoor and indoor! The first item on your big adventure itinerary is a stop at [Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/untamed-dunes/) where you can rent an [ATV and/or Dune Buggy](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/atv-motorsports/) for an exhilarating ride and memories that last a lifetime! The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area is a scenic area which includes the dunes, vegetation islands, various wildlife, and the breathtaking Pacific Ocean.

After exploring the largest expanse of coastal dunes in North America, it’s time to grab a late lunch or early dinner at [Clausen Oysters](http://www.clausenoysters.com/restaurant/), where you will taste some of the best oysters on the planet. Locals consistently recommend Clausens for their fresh and shucked oysters, as well as smoked oysters, BBQ Garlic-Parmesan Butter Oysters and other delicious selections. You cannot miss their signs when you are driving North or South on Highway 101, North of North Bend and North of McCullough Bridge.

Before checking into your hotel, be sure to stop in the [Coos Bay Visitor Information Center](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/contact/), where you will be welcomed with a smile and an abundance of information about Oregon’s South Coast (not to mention clean restrooms). Once you’ve had some time to rest and freshen up at your hotel or lodging property, head to the [Mill Casino Hotel & RV Park](https://www.themillcasino.com/) for a night of fun-filled [Vegas-style gaming](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/gamin)! Whether it's slots, cards, or games, you'll find round-the-clock adventure, fun, and (fingers crossed) maybe even a jack-pot prize! If you play your cards right, you can also hit [Three Rivers Casino – Coos Bay,](https://www.threeriverscasino.com/coos-bay-casino) just ten minutes away! That’s right, in the Coos Bay area, we have two casinos to choose from!

## Day Two: Cape Arago Hwy Loop, Charleston Marine Life Center, Fishing/Crabbing or Clamming, and a Night Out

Start your morning with a hotel breakfast or a delicious and hearty meal at the [Pancake Mill Restaurant and Pie Shoppe](http://www.pancakemill.com/). Depending on the day, there may be a wait - but it’s worth it! After breakfast, hop in the car and head towards Charleston, our quaint working fishing village, for a scenic drive like none other along the [Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/).

Along the 8 mile drive, you’ll find a trifecta of State Parks, including [Shore Acres State Park](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/shore-acres-state-park/) (Oregon Coast’s crown jewel), [Sunset Bay State Park](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=70) and [Cape Arago State Park](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=66). Here are some of our favorite ways to explore the loop:

* Take a walk and watch the surfers on Bastendorff Beach.
* Search for natural treasures in tidepools in the protected beach in Sunset Bay State Park.
* Take a scenic stroll along the breathtaking cliffs with majestic ocean views at Shore Acres State Park. Be sure to visit their famous gardens for a closer look at their stunning blooms. If your travels bring you here around the holidays, the gardens become a winter wonderland from Thanksgiving to New Year’s Eve, complete with festive lights and animated features.
* Visit the secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach, located directly below Shore Acres. A winding path takes you to this treasured “secret” beach, where you will find crashing waves and views of seals, sea lions, and other wildlife.
* Grab some binoculars and explore the Simpson Reef and nearby Shell Island, part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, to view the hundreds of seals and sea lions who call Shell Island home. There is no public access to the island itself, but viewing points can be found here, at Shore Acres State Park, and from the north trail of Cape Arago State Park.

For Complete Details, download our [PDF Guide for the Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/cape-arago-loop-itinerary.pdf).

On your way back to Coos Bay/North Bend, be sure to stop by [Cranberry Sweets](https://cranberrysweets.com/) for a sweet treat made from Oregon cranberries and other delectable flavors. You can watch candy being made most weekdays, while also sampling your heart out. We also recommend exploring the marina and boatyard in Charleston. With nearly 200 commercial fishing boats and 250 or so recreational boats, the docks and boatyard are busy year-round.

After a satisfying morning of adventure and wildlife viewing, grab a quick and delicious bite at one of the local seafood restaurants in Charleston, before an afternoon visit to the [Charleston Marine Life Center](https://cmlc.uoregon.edu/), located on the edge of the harbor in Charleston. Curious minds can discover various coastal ecosystems and experience a tide pool touch tank, whale and sea lion skeletons, underwater video from deep reefs and undersea volcanoes, and various specimens reveal the hidden and remarkable diversity of life off Oregon, from the coast to the deep sea. Open Wednesday through Saturday 11am-5pm.

Next up, head to [Davey Jones' Locker](https://www.facebook.com/Davey-Jones-Locker-275312836004/) to gear up for an afternoon of [fishing](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/fishing/), [crabbing](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/crabbing-clamming/) or [clamming](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/clamming/). Our local bait and tackle stores are a local treasure trove of fishing, clamming and crabbing tips and a great place to rent a crab ring. If [charter fishing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tour-guides-and-charters/) is more your speed, there are several businesses more than willing to help you make the most of your Oregon’s Adventure Coast experience!

After a fun day along our beautiful, rugged coast, head out for a relaxing, delicious meal from one of our [local restaurants](http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining) (too many to list). There are many establishments that have stood the test of time, like [Shark Bites in Coos Bay](http://www.sharkbites.cafe/home), [Hilltop House Restaurant and Lounge](https://hilltophouserestaurant.com/), [Blue Heron Bistro](http://www.blueheronbistro.net/),[ Captain’s Choice Family Fish House ](http://www.captainschoicefishhouse.com/)and many more. After dinner, head out for a beer and fun night of bowling at [The Back Alley Pub & Grill](https://northbendlanes.com/Back-Alley-Pub-Grill) at [North Bend Lanes,](https://northbendlanes.com/) or live music at [Liberty Pub](https://www.thelibpub.com/) (on select nights only). A trip to [7 Devils Brewing Co](http://www.7devilsbrewery.com/#/) in Coos Bay, recently featured in [Everyday Northwest](https://www.facebook.com/everydaynorthwest/?__tn__=-UC-R), will not disappoint!

## Day Three: Shopping, Coos History Museum and Goodbye!

After checking out of your hotel, grab some freshly brewed coffee and a delicious pasty at one of the many local [Coffee Shops & Bakeries](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.app/img/coffeeshops-bakery.pdf) that can be found throughout the area. Hunt for rare and special treasures to bring home from one of the many antique and specialty boutiques in Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston.

Head next to the Coos History Museum, where permanent and rotating exhibits give a perfect overview of the history and culture of Coos Bay and Coos County, before indulging in a delicious lunch at [7 Devils Waterfront Alehouse](http://www.7devilsbrewery.com/waterfront-alehouse.html#/) directly next door. There are also several options along Hwy 101 (Sherman Ave) in North Bend and downtown Coos Bay.

As you wrap up your amazing trip, stop by the Coos Bay Visitor Information Center once again to let us know how you enjoyed your adventures, and get a jump start planning your next visit!
