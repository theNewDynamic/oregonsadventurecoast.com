Mark your calendars now for one of the most unique and diverse celebrations of culture, food, farms, art, people, and places in the United States - the first-ever [Live Culture Coast](http://www.liveculturecoast.org). This nine-day event, beginning October 18 and ending October 27, celebrates the wonders of the 135 beautiful miles from Reedsport to Bookings.  Residents and visitors can register for over 90 hand-on experiences focused on art and culture, food and farms, and people and places all along the Oregon Southern Coast.

If you can only spend a few days at the festival, we’d love to have you in Coos Bay from October 19-22 to experience our region in a completely new way. Event registration is available online and will fill up quickly, so plan early. We also [recommend booking accommodations now](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/) as they are expected to fill up quickly.

Drop into the [HARVEST FAIR & CO-OP CELEBRATION](https://www.liveculturecoast.org/new-events/harvest-fair-amp-co-op-celebration-1) from 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM at the Coos Head Food Co-op, 353 S 2nd Street. Bring your apples to [Coos Head Food Co-op](http://coosheadfoodcoop.org/), a community-owned natural food store specializing in local, fresh, sustainable, and organic foods, and turn them into cider onsite with a wooden, hand-cranked cider press. With kids' activities, fermentation displays, and local foods, it’s the perfect place to celebrate harvest season.

"Hop" on over (get it?) to the [LIVING BEVERAGES: ALE TASTING & FERMENTATION TALES](https://www.liveculturecoast.org/new-events/living-beverages-ale-tasting-amp-fermentation-tales) event from 2:00-4:00 PM at [7 Devils Brewing](https://www.7devilsbrewery.com/), 247 S 2nd Street.

Enjoy an effervescent afternoon with brewer Carmen Matthews, CEO Annie Pollard, and the whole brew crew.

IMAGE 3 MOVIE

Just an easy five-minute walk away is the third Coos Bay event, [MOVIE NIGHT AT THE EGYPTIAN]() from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM at The Egyptian Theatre, 229 S Broadway.  The Egyptian Theatre looks (mostly) as it did nearly 100 years ago—velvet drapes and golden pharaohs. It's the place to be to watch

The Biggest Little Farm, which chronicles a couple's 8-year quest to bring 200 acres of barren farmland into harmony with nature.

The final event planned in Coos Bay is one of the best. The [LAKE + LIGHTHOUSE VAN TOUR](https://www.liveculturecoast.org/new-events/lake-lighthouse-van-tour) offers a unique opportunity to one of the magnificent lighthouses near Coos Bay, the Umpqua River Lighthouse. Tour the lighthouse in a van then take a short boat ride around the lovely Lake Marie. The tour, provided by South Coast Tours, runs from 2:00 PM – 4:00 PM and departs from 7 Devils Brewing, 247 S 2nd Street.

We can’t wait to see you in Coos Bay in October!
