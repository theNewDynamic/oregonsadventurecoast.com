#### “I run to see who has the most guts.” - Running phenom Steve Prefontaine

The [Bay Area Fun Festival](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/bay-area-fun-festival-2018/) is just over a month away (September 21-22, 2019), and runners everywhere are in the final stages of training for one of the Pacific Northwest's top road race: the [Prefontaine Memorial 10k Run](https://www.prefontainerun.com/).

Born and raised in Coos Bay, Steve “Pre” Prefontaine grew to become one of the most celebrated and legendary runners in American history. His [amazing story](https://www.prefontainerun.com/) and untimely death inspired this challenging (but rewarding) annual run. The 6.2-mile course takes participants through Pre’s old training courses and finishes at the high school track where he first competed.

If that doesn’t inspire you to lace up your running shoes, hopefully this will: we’ve gathered 90 minutes of some of our favorite hits – old and new – and created Oregon's Adventure Coast’s 40th Annual Prefontaine Memorial 10k Run playlist for you to download through Spotify to your smartphone. From Guns ‘n Roses to Lady Gaga, there’s sure to be a song that’ll put a little “Pre” pep in your step during training runs or the actual race day. Go ahead, get your best running gear, grab some ear buds or a speaker, and run like the wind (a very fast wind – make Pre proud!). Just make sure to turn down the volume at the finish line so you can hear the roar of the crowd and the sound of your own awesomeness.

See you out there!
