Fishing, wildlife viewing and exploring the peaceful waterways along Oregon's South Coast...these are a few of our favorite things. For the ultimate summertime adventure, it doesn't get much better than gliding along the water on a guided [kayak](/water-recreation) tour.

With so many calm lakes, rivers and beaches [to choose from,](/water-recreation) Oregon's Adventure Coast is a haven for kayakers of all skill levels. Though there are ample opportunities for going on your own, we think embarking on a guided tour from local companies like <a href="https://www.southcoasttours.net/">South Coast Tours</a> (SCT) is the way to go! SCT offers kayaking, stand up paddle boarding and kayak fishing from the Coos Bay area down to the California border and Brookings Harbor. The company is receiving much praise for their adventure paddle tours of rivers, estuaries and along shores of Oregon's Southern Coast.

The company's sincere passion for the outdoors and commitment to sustainability and ocean preservation sets them apart from many others. Taking a tour with one of their guides this summer is an excellent way to experience the natural beauty of the south coast like never before.

Though there are a number of fun-filled tours to choose from along the peaceful waterways and wild rivers up and down the coast, we've got our spotlight on the tours out of Coos Bay and Bandon, Oregon. Here are some options to consider:

<h2><b><a href="https://www.southcoasttours.net/tours/kayak-south-slough-coos-bay/">South Slough Coos Bay Wildlife Viewing Kayak Tour</a> with South Coast Tours</b></h2>

The South Slough of the Coos River is home to the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve which is a protected area of land and estuary. There are many birds that utilize this beautiful area such as Bald Eagles, Osprey, Great Blue Herons, Egrets and Belted Kingfishers. The tides are great in this estuary so we will plan to ride the ebbing and flowing tides to make this paddle a little easier. There are also Harbor Seals and Brown Pelicans making for a fun wildlife viewing tour. Total distance is about 4.6 miles over 2.5 hours.
