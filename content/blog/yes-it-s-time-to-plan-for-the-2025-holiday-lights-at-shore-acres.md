## Start Planning Your Visit Now to See the Holiday Lights at Shore Acres

The 2025 [Holiday Lights at Shore Acres State Park](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-holiday-lights-at-shore-acres/) runs nightly from 4:30 pm to 9:00 pm, November 27 through December 31, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The holiday lights are one of the most popular holiday traditions in the state, so [Oregon State Parks](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.feature-article&amp;articleId=364) has implemented a few logistical measures to ensure visitors' safety and a smooth operation. Even if you are familiar with these logistics, please read the following very carefully, as some of the information is new for 2025!

### Driving and Parking Info

![](/img/holiday-lights-blog-695x322.png)

**There is a $10 parking fee per vehicle to park at Shore Acres State Park.** Please be advised that Shore Acres State Park is one of Oregon's 25 state parks that charge a parking fee. As mentioned above, visitors who intend to drive should reserve their timed entry and pay the $10 parking fee in advance. *Note: Free parking is available for Green Friday, November 28, at all state parks that charge a parking fee during the daytime, including Shore Acres. However, this offer does not apply during event hours.*

**Timed-entry reservations for 2025 are now open.** To help traffic flow smoothly and keep everyone safe, [Oregon State Parks](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.feature-article&amp;articleId=364) requires visitors to reserve a timed-entry vehicle pass in advance. Visitors must reserve their date and time, and pay the $10 Oregon State Park parking fee BEFORE arrival. Only one pass is required per vehicle, not per person. **Reservations must be made in advance**; no onsite permits will be available for purchase during event hours. Visitors can make their reservations by visiting[<u>bit.ly/2025holidaylights</u>](https://bit.ly/2025holidaylights) or calling ReserveAmerica at 800-452-5687, Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

***Tip:** Weekends are the busiest. For a more relaxed experience, consider visiting on Monday through Thursday or earlier in the evening to enjoy the daylight, sunset, and lights all in one trip.*

**IMPORTANT! Print or save a screenshot of your pass before you leave for the park.** Park staff will check each vehicle upon arrival to verify that it has a valid vehicle reservation pass for the correct date and time. To keep traffic moving, have your pass, permit, or confirmation clearly showing the date, time, ticket ID, and visitor name printed or saved to your phone and ready to show park staff. ***There is no internet at the park, so visitors may not be able to access their ReserveAmerica account***.

**All vehicles without a 4:30 reservation must leave Shore Acres State Park by 4 pm.** All guests without a 4:30 pm vehicle reservation for Holiday Lights must remove their vehicle from the park by 4 pm to accommodate timed entry and parking ticket arrivals. For visitor and vehicle safety, parking at nearby day-use areas, overlooks, or along the highway after dusk is prohibited.

**What to do if your preferred date/time is not available:** If your preferred date and time are sold out when you seek to make a reservation, you have another opportunity via the 7-day rolling window that begins on November 20 (for Thanksgiving night) at 6:00 am ([click here for more information on the 7-day rolling window](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.feature-article&amp;articleId=364)). The rolling window opens 7 days in advance of each date of the run of the lights, i.e. Nov 20 for Nov 27, Nov 21 for Nov 28, etc.

[Click here](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.feature-article&amp;articleId=364) for answers to more commonly asked questions. You can also call the OPRD Information line at 800-551-6949, and one of their information operators will help you. The line is open Monday through Friday, from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.

### Don't Want to Drive?

If you are looking for an alternative to the timed entry parking and reservation system, there's a simple solution: **Santa's Shuttle!**

### A Volunteer-Driven Tradition for 37 Years and Counting

What this army of volunteers, known as the [Friends of Shore Acres](https://shoreacres.net/about-us/about-friends-of-shore-acres-inc/), has accomplished each year for the last 37 years is nothing short of remarkable. The Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres tradition began in 1987 with just 6,000 lights, a decorated Christmas tree, and a handful of volunteers. That first year drew an impressive 9,000 visitors.

Fast forward to today, and the event is expected to welcome more than 55,000 people from across the globe, all thanks to the 1,500+ volunteers who make the magic happen. This dedicated team transforms the formal gardens at Shore Acres into a dazzling, walkable wonderland that becomes even more impressive with each passing season. The current display features 26 beautifully decorated Christmas trees, handcrafted animated and stationary sculptures, and tens of thousands of LED lights woven through the trees and shrubs. Visitors are warmly welcomed at the Garden House with cookies, cider, and the opportunity to support the volunteers who make it all happen.

Planning for the upcoming display begins in January each year. By spring and summer, volunteers are busy creating and refurbishing sculptures. By October of each year, they start the massive six-week installation, stringing lights through towering trees, setting up animated displays, and decorating the historic Garden House. Every detail is meticulously crafted by hand with care and a sense of community spirit.
