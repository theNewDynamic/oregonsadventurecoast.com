## Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres by the Numbers

![](/img/holiday-lights-at-shore-acres-by-the-numbers-blog-695x322-jpg-3.jpg)

**34 —** the number of times the Friends of Shore Acres have put on the annual holiday light display since it began in 1987. This number would likely have been 36 had it not been dark in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**6,000** – the number of miniature lights at the very first display in 1987. A small group of volunteers gathered to hang the lights, decorate one large Christmas tree along with the Garden House.

**9,000** – the number of visitors the holiday lights attracted during its first season.

**53,000** – the estimated number of visitors who attended the Holiday Lights at Shore Acres display in 2023. This impressive turnout highlights the event’s enduring popularity, as people from all over the country and beyond flocked to witness the magical transformation of the park.

**325,000** – the estimated number of holiday lights (nearly all LED) in this year's dazzling display. The spectacle includes 26 beautiful Christmas trees, a variety of illuminated sculptures—some of them animated—and enchanting landscape lights adorning the majestic trees surrounding the garden.

**1,500** – the estimated number of volunteers organized by Friends of Shore Acres to bring the holiday display to life this year. Sculpture displays, light stringers, tree decorators, and house decorators work tirelessly to complete the setup by Thanksgiving. The total volunteer force includes not only those setting up lights, but also button makers, spice makers, lights checkers, house cleaners, host teams, and Information and Gift Center volunteers.

Visitors can stroll through Shore Acres State Park, enjoying festive displays and the magic of holiday lights, rain or shine, for a memorable seasonal experience.

**6** – the number of weeks it takes to set up this year’s display. Planning for the season begins in January with inventory, completing the lighting plan and ordering replacement lights.

We look forward to welcoming our Holiday Lights visitors back to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston** in 2024! When planning your visit, keep in mind that Fridays through Sundays are the busiest, so we recommend coming Monday through Thursday if possible. If you're driving, remember that Oregon State Parks requires <a href="https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/tourParkDetail.do?contractCode=OR&amp;parkId=402381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a timed entry</a> **parking pass**, so be sure to book it in advance and have a printed copy or screenshot ready to show the park ranger upon arrival. If you are coming on the weekend, consider taking the Free Santa’s Shuttle and skip the hassle of booking a parking pass. We suggest booking an earlier time slot to enjoy the ocean views, explore the park, and witness the lights' magical transition from daylight to dark. And don’t worry about rain—there's less traffic, and the lights look especially beautiful when it’s wet!
