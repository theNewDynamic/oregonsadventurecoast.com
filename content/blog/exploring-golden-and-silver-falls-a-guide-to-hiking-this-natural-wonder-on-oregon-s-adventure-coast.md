**How to get there.** Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area is located about 24 miles northeast of [Coos Bay](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/our-area-coos-bay/), and takes roughly an hour to reach by car. But don't let that deter you; the journey itself is part of the adventure, leading you through dense forests and along the scenic Coos River. From Coos Bay, take Highway 241 (Coos River Highway) and follow the signs to Allegany. Continue on the narrow, gravel road from Allegany to the park. Although the drive may feel remote, the destination is well worth the effort. ** ** [Get directions here.](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/Golden-Silver-Falls-Directions.pdf)

![](/img/golden-and-silver-falls-natural-area-oregon-s-adventure-coast-1-1.jpg)<br><br>**Choosing Your Trail.** Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area offers three main trails (two that go to the bases of both falls and one that goes to the midpoint of Silver Falls and the top of Golden Falls). Each of the three trails offer the perfect blend of enchanting forest scenery and untouched natural beauty that can be accessed by walkers and hikers of all skill levels.<br>

The Golden Falls trail is a moderate hike, approximately 1.5 miles round trip, and follows a well-maintained trail that winds through old-growth forests of towering Douglas firs and vibrant greenery, gradually leading to a viewpoint at the top of Golden Falls. As you approach the falls, the sound of rushing water grows louder, and the air becomes cooler and mistier. Once you arrive at the top, you will be treated to unsurpassed panoramic views as you marvel at the 254-foot waterfall. Silver Falls, though slightly shorter at around 100 feet, is equally magnificent. The vantage points along the trail offer spectacular views of the falls and the surrounding forest. In the spring and early summer, wildflowers bloom along the path, adding a splash of color to the verdant scenery.
