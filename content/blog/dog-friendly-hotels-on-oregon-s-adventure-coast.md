Where Can Pets Play & Stay in the Coos Bay \~ North Bend \~ Charleston area?

_“Is Coos Bay a dog-friendly town?”_

_“Are pets allowed on the beaches in North Bend & Charleston?”_

_“Are there any pet-friendly hotels in the area?”_

These are questions we get quite a bit and the short answer to all three is YES. Pets are part of the family, and what’s a family vacation to Oregon’s Adventure Coast without the whole family in tow? We welcome travelers AND their furry friends! Here is a list of several of our “pet-friendly” play areas and lodging options in the Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston area.

### **Where Can Dogs Play?**
There are plenty of pet-friendly play areas for your four-legged friends to explore. Many of the hiking trails and state parks allow dogs as long as they are on leashes (be sure to check the park’s pet policy before you go). Make sure you bring plenty of water for your furry friend (rule of thumb is 1 quart of water for your dog for every three miles you plan to hike). Travel Oregon has some great tips for travelers and their four legged friends. Read [Tails & Trails: Hiking the Coast with a Dog](http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/oregon-stories/tails-trails-hiking-the-coast-with-a-dog/) if a hiking trip is part of your itinerary.

If you’re looking for a beach to play on, Horsfall Beach in North Bend and Bastendorff Beach in Charleston are two of the most beloved spots for pet owners. Dogs (and their humans) have long stretches of beach for them to run and play. As an added bonus, dogs are allowed off-leash provided they are well behaved and under owner’s control at all times. Please never, EVER leave your dog unattended. Even the most well-trained dog can get distracted; pay extra special attention to your surroundings and any potential situations that may cause your dog to wander or run off. And Never turn your back on the ocean, even when it seems relatively calm a sneaker wave is possible.
