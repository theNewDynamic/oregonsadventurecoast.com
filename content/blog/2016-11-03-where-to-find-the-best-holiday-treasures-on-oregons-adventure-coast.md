### For the Young (and the Young at Heart)

**Remember When Toys** “We LOVE this place,” raves a recent online reviewer. The lady who owns it loves kids and toys and encourages you to play with and touch things. She’s gives great suggestions if you tell her who you’re shopping for. She has really high quality toys (which are surprisingly not over-priced- very affordable) and also cheaper ones for when my kids want to go spend a few dollars.She has nostalgic stuff and newer stuff. Nothing requires batteries, and I adore that!” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Remember-When-Toys/504753686344281" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/pages/Remember-When-Toys</a>
