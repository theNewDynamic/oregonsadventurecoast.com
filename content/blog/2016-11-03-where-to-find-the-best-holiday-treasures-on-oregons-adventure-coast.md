### For the Young (and the Young at Heart)

**Remember When Toys** &#8220;We LOVE this place,&#8221; raves a recent online reviewer. The lady who owns it loves kids and toys and encourages you to play with and touch things. She&#8217;s gives great suggestions if you tell her who you&#8217;re shopping for. She has really high quality toys (which are surprisingly not over-priced- very affordable) and also cheaper ones for when my kids want to go spend a few dollars.She has nostalgic stuff and newer stuff. Nothing requires batteries, and I adore that!&#8221; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Remember-When-Toys/504753686344281" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/pages/Remember-When-Toys</a>
