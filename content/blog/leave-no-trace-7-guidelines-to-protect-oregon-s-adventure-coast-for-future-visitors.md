Some of the most stunning and diverse landscapes in the country are right in our backyard, offering a wide range of outdoor experiences and countless opportunities to reconnect with nature. Whether you’re into [hiking](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking), [beachcombing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches), [wildlife watching](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/birding-and-wildlife), <u>tide pooling</u>, [fishing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing), [biking](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/cycling/), or [kayaking](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation) (the list goes on and on) — there is something appealing for everyone in this special destination.

As we embrace all that Oregon’s South Coast has to offer, it's important to remember that being good stewards of the land is a responsibility we all share. Our love for the outdoors can have a detrimental impact on our natural resources such as litter, erosion, invasive species, human-dependent wildlife, polluted water sources, and more. While these consequences are rarely intentional; we may lack the knowledge or overlook behaviors that help preserve these areas for future generations. In this post, we’ll outline effective ways to protect our natural environment and ensure it remains for future generations by following the [7 Leave No Trace principles](https://lnt.org/learn/seven-principles-overview).

###### ![](/img/leave-no-trace-blog-695x322-jpg.jpg)<br>***What are Leave No Trace (LNT) Principles?***

Leave No Trace (LNT) Principles serve as a guide to sustainable and responsible travel. By following these guidelines, you can protect both yourself and Oregon's natural beauty and unique ecosystems for future generations. Here are some ways to apply the LNT Principles and help preserve the amazing natural treasures on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**.

###### LNT Principle \#1- Plan Ahead and Prepare

We want our visitors to have a safe and enjoyable experience while exploring outdoor destinations on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston. To achieve this, preparation is key! Plan ahead by researching trail conditions, weather patterns, and local regulations, and always have a backup plan if parking lots or trails are full. Pack the right gear, including extra layers and a map or GPS, and notify someone of your route. Stay informed about tide times and ocean safety to ensure a peaceful day by the Pacific. Visitors should always remain alert to coastal safety hazards, including the potential dangers of undertows, sneaker waves, and rolling logs—regardless of conditions.

###### LNT Principle \#2- Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces

When exploring Oregon’s Adventure Coast, stick to established trails and campsites to protect fragile ecosystems and prevent soil erosion. When picnicking or camping- seek durable surfaces like rock, gravel, or dry grass at least 200 feet from lakes and streams. By treading lightly, you help preserve the natural beauty of the region for future visitors.

###### LNT Principle \#3- Dispose of Waste Properly

To keep Oregon’s Adventure Coast clean and beautiful, dispose of all waste properly by “packing out trash” — this means taking all your waste (including food scraps and litter) with you and properly disposing of it elsewhere to keep natural areas clean and minimize environmental impact. When camping, use designated waste disposal facilities at least 200 feet from water. Always wash dishes and yourself away from streams, and pack out toilet paper and pet waste. By handling waste responsibly, you help protect the environment and preserve its beauty for future visitors.

###### LNT Principle \#4: Leave What You Find

Respect the natural beauty on Oregon’s Adventure Coast by leaving everything as you found it. Avoid disturbing wildlife, picking plants, or moving rocks. Hike only on established trails and avoid building structures or leaving graffiti. Before you go and after you return, clean your gear to prevent the spread of invasive species and preserve the region's ecological balance. By minimizing your impact, you help maintain our natural surroundings for future generations to enjoy.

###### LNT Principle \#5: Minimize Campfire Impacts

While campfires can be a fun camping tradition, they can also harm the environment. Consider using a camp stove for cooking and stargazing instead of a fire. \*\* \*\* If fires are allowed, use established fire rings, keep them small, and only burn small sticks. Always fully extinguish the fire before leaving, and never bring firewood from home to avoid introducing pestsand non-native species to the environment.

###### LNT Principle \#6: Respect Wildlife

This principle is especially near and dear to our hearts. Respect Oregon’s wildlife by observing animals (like baby seal pups) from a distance and never attempt to touch or interact with them — it is after all, their home. Avoid feeding wildlife, as it disrupts their natural behavior and can endanger them. Store food securely to prevent animals from becoming dependent on human food, and keep pets under control to protect both wildlife and your pet.

###### LNT Principle \#7: Be Considerate of Other Visitors

Help create a positive experience for everyone seeking solitude and adventure on Oregon’s Adventure Coast by respecting others and showing them courtesy. Some examples of this behavior include keeping noise to a minimum, yielding to others on the trail, and respecting their personal boundaries. Walk, run, hike, and ride only on designated trails and keep pets, (yes, even well-behaved ones), on a leash and clean up after them.
