What began as a small celebration of local culture, art, people, history and music has grown into a popular, fun filled multi-day event; and it&#8217;s happening at the <a href="http://www.charlestonmarina.com/" target="_blank">Charleston Marina</a> the first weekend in October.  This growing community festival raises funds for the Charleston Food Pantry and the Charleston Marine Life Science Center.
