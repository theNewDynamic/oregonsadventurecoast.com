### *New Ice Skating Rink and Holiday Traditions Put Downtown North Bend on the Map of Winter Destinations!*

North Bend, Oregon. Not only is this city a central part of Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston, it is a destination steeped in beauty, history, and hidden gems. From historically significant landmarks like the [Conde B. McCullough Memorial Bridge](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/spotlight-on-conde-b.mccullough-memorial-bridge/) and the [Oregon Merci Boxcar](http://mercitrain.org/Oregon/) to natural wonders like the [Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=42465), North Bend is known for many of our region’s most beloved attractions.

North Bend’s lovely downtown area already abounds with unique shops and restaurants, but the city recently implemented special winter traditions to attract new visitors and keep spirits bright this holiday season and beyond. It all began the first Saturday of December when Santa, Mrs. Claus and their elves descended onto downtown North Bend with a day packed with events and festivities like Waffles with Santa, Storytime with Mrs. Claus at the North Bend Public Library, a Holiday Block Party, the Annual North Bend Tree Lighting, a Lighted Truck Parade, and skating in the city’s newest winter attraction, the [North Bend Ice Skating Rink](https://www.northbendoregon.us/newsview.aspx?nid=7394).

The new ice skating rink opened earlier this month to a curious and enthusiastic crowd, and will remain open Wednesday through Saturday until Valentine’s Day. The public is welcome to skate from 4 to 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Friday and noon to 4 p.m. Saturdays. There is no fee to enter, but ice skate rental is $5 an hour. Anyone with their own ice skates can skate for free.

“A holiday market and an artificial ice skating rink are almost essential to making downtown North Bend festive at Christmas,” it says on the City of North Bend website. “The ecological synthetic ice skating rink is expected to attract people of all ages, becoming the main leisure activity downtown during the holiday season, and increasing traffic to our central business district and beyond.”

The 3,250 sq. ft. synthetic ice skating rink is housed in a 60-foot by 83-foot translucent event tent, and the city plans to open and operate the rink annually between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day.

For much of Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston, Christmas of 2022 will be remembered for its bright lights and festive sights. If you missed the holiday festivities earlier this month, these photos help capture the spirit and joy of the day, especially the annual North Bend Lighted Truck Parade, founded in 2018 by Allen "Gator" R. Fields, who passed away in 2020 at the age of 57.
