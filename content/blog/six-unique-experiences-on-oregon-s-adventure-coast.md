What makes **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** a one-of-a-kind destination? Is it the rustic natural beauty that can only be found along Oregon’s most beautiful stretch of coastal land? Maybe it’s the rare trifecta of [state parks](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands) along Cape Arago Highway or easy access to the [largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/untamed-dunes).

Perhaps it's our rich [history & culture](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/art-history-culture) that sets our region apart from the rest. Even our geographic location, uniquely situated where the land meets the bay and the sea - opens up endless possibilities for anyone in search of new and exciting adventures. Regardless of the reason, Oregon’s Adventure Coast is the perfect destination for visitors hoping to rediscover their adventurous side as they explore nature, wildlife, food, and culture. Here’s a list of unique experiences we don’t always highlight, but are here for visitors to enjoy any time of the year in Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston.

[Lighthouses](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lighthouses) have a long, fascinating history on the Oregon Coast, but there is something especially unique and mysterious about [Southern Oregon Coast Lighthouses](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/southern-oregon-coast-lighthouses/).
