#### <h2>‘Crack Up’ fresh Oregon Dungeness Crab from Charleston at the North Bend Community Center on Saturday, February 9th, 2019!</h2>

The Charleston fishing village is bringing Oregon’s fresh Dungeness crab harvest to YOU at the <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/annual-charleston-crab-feed-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">35th Annual Charleston Crab Feed Fundraiser</a> Saturday, February 9th, 2019 at The North Bend Community Center!

The event will be from 11 AM to 3 PM at the North Bend Community Center, 2222 Broadway Ave. in North Bend, OR 97459. This is the main fundraising event for our friends at the <a href="http://visittheoregoncoast.com/cities/charleston/activities/charleston-visitor-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charleston Visitor Center</a> but also provides funding to other needs in the Charleston community.

“This is one of the community’s favorite festivals. It gives locals and visitors a chance to meet with old friends and make new ones while cracking tasty Oregon Dungeness crab,” said Harbormaster John Buckley. “Our Dungeness crab fishery is certified sustainable, and all of the large meaty crab the volunteers serve at the festival is caught by our very own Charleston fishermen.”

Volunteers will serve whole or half fresh crab dinners with side dishes, rolls, and a beverage. <strong>*Projected prices:</strong> Whole crab dinners are $20 and half crab dinners at $16 but prices are subject to the market. Make sure to leave room for dessert as pies and cakes will be available for $1 per slice. There will also be local wine, craft beer, crab bibs, entertainment and much much more!

Crab Feeds have been celebrated here on Oregon's Adventure Coast for <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/2013/01/crab-feeds-have-been-celebrated-in-charleston-oregon-for-generations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generations</a>.

The <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/annual-charleston-crab-feed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charleston Crab Feed</a> is one of our favorite ways to celebrate the bounty of the sea and has been a local tradition for generations.  While you are here, stroll around the Charleston Harbor- a bustling marina serving charter boat operators, sports fishermen, crabbers and recreational boaters. The harbor offers wonderful views & a variety of shops/restaurants. Learn about marine life at the Charleston Marine Life Center, go crabbing off the docks at the Charleston Marina Shore, storm watch at Shore Acres, Sunset Bay and Cape Arago State Parks, and hike the trails at South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. All are popular recreation spots just minutes away! <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book your trip to the Oregon Coast</a> for this special feast you won't want to miss!</p>
