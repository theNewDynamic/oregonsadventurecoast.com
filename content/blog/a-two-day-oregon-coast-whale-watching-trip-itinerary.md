### The Whole Family Will Have a "Whale of a Time" During Winter 2019 Whale Watching Week- December 27th – 31st, 2019

Thinking about heading to Oregon’s Adventure Coast this holiday season? If so, you’re in for a “fin-tastic” time. Not only is this home to the infamous Shore Acre Holiday Lights Display (we’ll talk about that in a moment), visitors will have an amazing opportunity to see some of the thousands of Gray whales migrating south in the Pacific Ocean during Winter Whale Watch Week: Friday, December 27th through Tuesday, December 31st.

Thanks to the dedicated and knowledgeable volunteers from the [Whale Watching Spoken Here®](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=thingstodo.dsp_whalewatching) program, Oregon Coast visitors can learn important lessons about these mysterious and awe-inspiring creatures and their annual migration, for FREE. Bring your binoculars and plan to stop at one of the[ designated Whale Watching Spoken Here® sites](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&t=m&msa=0&z=7&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zweC21xpv7NQ.krK2xC0y40W4) (like Shore Acres State Park) between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. during the 2019 Winter Whale Watch Week and you just may witness the beautiful sight of Gray whales blowing, breaching and fluking as they pass by on their 12,000-mile journey. To help you plan your trip, here is a 2-day Winter Whale Watching itinerary the whole family will enjoy with options for indoor and outdoor activities. Tip- be sure to dress the family in layers and bring rain jackets!

Afterward, go for a stroll along the [Charleston Marina Complex](https://www.portofcoosbay.com/marinahome), about a half-mile down the road to check out the fishing vessels and local wildlife.
