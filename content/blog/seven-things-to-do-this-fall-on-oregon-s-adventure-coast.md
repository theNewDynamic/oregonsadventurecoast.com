<br>**\#5 See the Colorful Dahlias at Shore Acres State Park.** Before the popular Holiday Lights Display begins on Thanksgiving Day (November 27, 2025), the all-seasons garden that was once part of Louis J. Simpson's private estate has one more seasonal highlight to share before winter sets in - bright, bold, colorful dahlias. With 250–300 varieties blooming in a rainbow of hues and shapes, the garden takes on a dreamlike quality. [Willamette Week](https://www.wweek.com/promotions/2022/05/17/heres-everything-i-plan-to-do-on-my-summer-trip-to-the-southern-oregon-coast/) says a visit to Shore Acres is "like stepping into a magical Disney movie, or maybe a Monet painting - truly an escape."

Visitors will also discover a remarkable collection of flowers, plants, evergreen shrubs, and trees (including Oregon’s largest Monterey Pine), in this beloved garden, as well as incredible views of the Pacific Ocean. The onsite greenhouse showcases a beautiful display of succulents, bromeliads, begonias, ferns, and other rare plants. For a schedule of what's in bloom, download this [<u>Garden Map – Best Times at Shore Acres</u>](https://shoreacres.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Garden-Map-Card-web.pdf) and/or visit [Friends of Shore Acres, Inc.](https://shoreacres.net/about-us/about-friends-of-shore-acres-inc/) for hours and more information. *\*\*Please note there is a $10 fee per vehicle to park at Shore Acres State Park\*\**
