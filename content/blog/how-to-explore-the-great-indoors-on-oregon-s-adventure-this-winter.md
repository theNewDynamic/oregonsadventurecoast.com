**Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** is certainly known for the variety of epic outdoor adventures for visitors to experience (think [<u>water recreation</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation), [<u>running,</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/running) [<u>ATVing</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/atv-motorsports), [<u>hiking</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking), [<u>golfing</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/golfing), [<u>cycling</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/cycling), [<u>fishing</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing), [<u>beachcombing</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/), etc), but it’s a little known fact that there are plenty of fantastic indoor adventures to enjoy.

That’s not to say outdoor adventures are off limits during the winter months! After all, our beautiful [<u>undeveloped beaches, </u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches)[<u>untamed dunes</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/untamed-dunes), and the popular [<u>Whiskey Run Mountain Biking Trail System</u>](https://www.mtbproject.com/directory/8019222/whiskey-run-trails) are just some of the outdoor attractions accessible year round. Not to mention, it’s not uncommon to experience days with surprisingly beautiful and balmy days of sunshine during the winter months along the Oregon Coast.&nbsp;

But what does one do on those days when the weather isn’t cooperating and the outdoors don’t seem as appealing? Not to worry, here are ideas to have a great time while staying out of the cold:

### Dive Into the The Charleston Marine Life Center

Come explore the center’s touch tide pool, fossil displays, and live sea creature tanks as you view the fishing boats unloading their catch from across the dock.&nbsp;

### Go Ice Skating (through Feb 14, 2024)
