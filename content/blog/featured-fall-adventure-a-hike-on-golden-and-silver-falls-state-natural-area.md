Summer may be over, but the need for fresh-air and adventure is year-round. Fortunately, there are plenty of outdoor activities that can be enjoyed well into the autumn months and beyond on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**! Hiking Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area, “a hidden gem” in our region, is high on our list of outdoor favorites.

![](/img/hiking-falls.jpg)Hundreds of hikers from all over have embarked on this delightful adventure, traversing dense coastal forests, enjoying stunning river views, majestic Oregon myrtle trees, and spectacular views of the falls. The best part is you don’t even have to be a skilled or expert hiker to reap the rewards of your journey! A relatively short hike leads to the breathtaking waterfalls shooting out onto boulders a hundred feet below.

“Beautiful hike, beautiful falls. Not too crowded. Mostly shaded. Loved this hike!” said Ken C. in August 2022 on [All Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/golden-and-silver-falls). “The falls are beautiful and the hike itself is really easy. Awesome place to bring kiddos,” said Tessa S. in June 2022. Even a winter hike to the falls is quite the adventure, according to Patrick G. In Jan 2022, he posted “What a gem! A winding drive out, but worth it…View from the upper Golden Falls is best of all…”.

Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area is the ideal place to unwind and reconnect with nature for a day. It is located 26 miles from Coos Bay and worth the trip (the drive is part of the magical adventure!). Ready to give it a try? Here are some tips to help you make the most of your day!

* Check the local forecast before you go. Even though the falls are a short drive from Coos Bay, they are inland, so the weather can feel different than what you’re experiencing on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.
* Bring a picnic lunch, as there are picnic areas at the bottom of the trails.
* Dogs are welcome as long as they’re kept on their leash!
* Stay hydrated! We recommend bringing a refillable drinking bottle with you.
* Wear Hiking Boots (waterproof ones are the best)! The trails can sometimes get slippery, and sneakers may not provide enough traction.
* Dress in layers, as it allows you to adjust for temperature changes. You can’t go wrong with a light, waterproof jacket.
* Similarly, wear a hat to give yourself some shade! If it’s a sunny day, you’ll be thankful you have it, and if it rains…you’ll be thankful you have it, too.
* Hike in a group whenever possible. Not only does it make for a much more enjoyable time, but you can also keep an eye on each other and avoid potentially problematic situations. If you are not hiking with a group, tell someone where you are going and when you will be back!
* Leave the area better than you found it. Pack out what you pack in and dispose of trash in proper receptacles.2 If you see someone else’s trash along the way, why not pick it up and toss it too? This tip also extends to leaving nature as you found it; so don’t pick flowers, break boulders, carve trees, or any other such behavior. When in doubt, leave it alone.

A note about the drive up Hwy 241. Please be aware that the road leading up to the parking area for Golden & Silver Falls is sometimes only one lane and more dirt than pavement. Take the drive slowly to avoid potentially dangerous situations, including meeting other vehicles traveling in the opposite direction and rough traveling conditions. Believe us when we say, the drive up is part of the adventure! And well worth the effort.
