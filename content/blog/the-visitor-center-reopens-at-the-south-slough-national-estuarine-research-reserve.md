### *South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR) Welcomes Back Visitors with Regular Hours, a New Exhibit, and a Calendar of Community Programs!*

Little by little, a return to something resembling “normal” is gradually happening here on [Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/our-area/). We recently learned that the [Charleston Marine Life Center](https://cmlc.uoregon.edu/)has returned to their normal hours, and we’re now happy to report that [South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR)](https://www.oregon.gov/DSL/SS/Pages/About.aspx) is re-opening the doors of its Visitor Center after two years of limited operations!

SSNERR is a natural area and center for coastal education, research, stewardship, and training. The 7,000 acres of protected wetlands, forests, and riparian areas, located along the Coos Estuary, is perfect for families, [hikers](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Documents/south_slough_brochure_0415.pdf), [kayakers](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Documents/Paddling%20South%20Slough.pdf), [wild-life watchers](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/flock-to-oregon-s-adventure-coast-for-premier-bird-watching/) and everyone in between.

**The Visitor Center, which has interpretive exhibits on coastal ecosystems, plants and animals, cultural history, science, is now open to the public every Tuesday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.** Restrooms for trail users, interpretive program attendees, and other visitors are open Monday through Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

### **A New Exhibit!**

As part of a partnership with local Tribes, South Slough NERR is also displaying a new exhibit inside the newly reopened Visitor Center! Among other historical and natural treasures, the exhibit features a fragment of a Native American canoe that washed out of a creek bed at Sunset Bay State Park in 2015. The precious artifact has been carefully preserved through a partnership between the Coquille Indian Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, and the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. Displaying the fragment at South Slough Reserve in collaboration with these partners helps to keep the canoe close to where it was found.

If you haven’t had the opportunity to visit South Slough NERR, we urge you to do so! In addition to exploring the Visitor Center and various hiking trails around South Slough Reserve, adults and children can also take part in [multiple events and classes](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/CommunityClassReg.aspx)scheduled in the coming months. [Guided hikes](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Documents/south_slough_brochure_0415.pdf), kayak and canoe trips, birding and other community classes are now open for registration. Many of these events are free. Learn more and register on the South Slough Reserve website.
