There is nothing like a heaping bowl of hot Clam Chowder to warm you up after a day of fishing, shopping, <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/whale-watching-week-at-cape-arago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whale Watching</a>, checking out Holiday Lights at <a href="http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shore Acres State Park </a>or any of our other attractions.



A few weeks ago, we conducted a very unscientific and unofficial poll on our Facebook page to settle a debate we're having here at The Visitor's Center. The topic? <strong>Which local restaurant serves the very best clam chowder?</strong> It's a question our visitors often ask, and though we all firmly have our own opinions, we wanted to know what you thought.



Many of you weighed in with a very interesting range of suggestions in a variety of locations, but we're looking for the best spots right here in Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston. Here are the local places that our Facebook fans claim to serve up "the best clam chowder in town."

Unfortunately, we cannot list every single recommended place in this post, so if you don't see your favorite <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/eat-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local restaurant </a>mentioned here, speak up!  Leave a comment!  Here are some of the spots mentioned by our fabulous locals and Facebook followers:

<h2>Winner: High Tide Cafe,  91124 Cape Arago Hwy, Charleston</h2>

It should come as no surprise that the <a href="http://hightidecafeoregon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Tide Café</a> in Charleston, Oregon is the winner of our unofficial Facebook poll.  High Tide has won multiple awards for their chowder and is a consistent favorite among locals and visitors. Dawna B. posted "The best way to have their famous clam chowder is to also order a grilled cheese with shrimp. Simply wonderful!!!" Who can argue with that? With its roaring fireplace, awesome fish &amp; chips, great beer, and over the top Clam Chowder, it's definitely worth the trip! Served daily and definitely a meal all on its own.
