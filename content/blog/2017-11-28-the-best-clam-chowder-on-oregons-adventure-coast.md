There is nothing like a&nbsp;heaping bowl of hot Clam Chowder to warm you up after a day of fishing, shopping, <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/whale-watching-week-at-cape-arago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whale Watching</a>, checking out Holiday Lights at <a href="http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shore Acres State Park </a>or any of our other attractions.

A few weeks ago, we conducted a very unscientific and unofficial poll on our Facebook page to settle a debate we're having here at The Visitor's Center. The topic? **Which local restaurant serves the very best clam chowder?** It's a question our visitors often ask, and though we all firmly have our own opinions, we wanted to know what you thought.

Many of you weighed in with a very interesting range of suggestions in a variety of locations, but we're looking for the best spots right here in Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston. Here are the local places that our Facebook fans claim to serve up "the best clam chowder in town."

Unfortunately, we cannot list every single recommended place in this post, so if you don't see your favorite <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/eat-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local restaurant </a>mentioned here, speak up! &nbsp;Leave a comment! &nbsp;Here are some of the spots mentioned by our fabulous locals and Facebook followers:

## Winner: High Tide Cafe, &nbsp;91124 Cape Arago Hwy, Charleston

It should come as no surprise that the&nbsp;<a href="http://hightidecafeoregon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Tide Café</a>&nbsp;in Charleston, Oregon is the winner of our unofficial Facebook poll.&nbsp; High Tide has won multiple awards for their chowder and is a consistent favorite among locals and visitors. Dawna B. posted "The best way to have their famous clam chowder is to also order a grilled cheese with shrimp. Simply wonderful!!!" Who can argue with that?&nbsp;With its roaring fireplace, awesome fish & chips, great beer, and over the top Clam Chowder, it's definitely worth the trip! Served daily and definitely a meal all on its own.

## Runners-Up

The chowder served up at these dining establishments were also recommended with great enthusiasm multiple times in our poll and worth a visit next time you're visiting Oregon's Adventure Coast.

The Plank House Restaurant in The Mill Casino not only has some of the best clam chowder in Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston, this restaurant has one of the best views of the bay!

**<a href="http://fishermensseafoodmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fisherman's Seafood Market</a>&nbsp;200 S Bayshore Dr, Coos Bay, OR 97420**

This local gem, famous for their chowder, fish & chips and local fresh seafood case, can be found floating under the boardwalk, off Highway 101. Hours are seasonal so call before making the trip: (541)267-CRAB(2722).

**<a href="http://www.sharkbites.cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shark Bites</a>&nbsp;240 S Broadway, Coos Bay**

Open since 2008 and owned by Coos Bay locals, their clam chowder is also a local favorite. The restaurant also offers an excellent selection of fresh and local seafood options.
