Here are a few fun facts about the South Coast Clambake Music Festival you may not have known!

**\#1 - Despite the title, the South Coast Clambake Music Festival has nothing to do with clams.** “Clambake” is an old-school term used by performers dating back to 1937 that means “jam session”. While the word is well-known among jazz musicians and performers, it sometimes puzzles newcomers who are surprised to learn that clams are not served during the festival. Rest assured, there’s no shortage of fresh seafood nearby! Local restaurants throughout Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston serve up plenty of clam chowder, fish and chips, and other favorites to satisfy your seafood cravings. [Click here](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/) to see our local dining options (and yes, many of these restaurants DO have clams on the menu).

**\#2 - Elvis once starred in a movie called** ***Clambake*****.** In 1967, the one and only Elvis Presley starred in a film called *Clambake*, a feel-good beach musical comedy. While the film wasn't a critical success, it became a cult favorite among Elvis fans, and its soundtrack still holds a special place in his music catalog. To celebrate the festival, there will be a screening at the [Historic Egyptian Theatre](https://www.egyptiantheatre.events/) in downtown Coos Bay on Friday, March 14th @ 7pm. Visit [www.egyptiantheatre.events](https://www.egyptiantheatre.events/) to learn more.

It’s a special opportunity for young attendees to discover new music, dance, and experience the local arts scene. Youth All-Events Badges are just $20 for ages 13 to 20 (with student ID), while children 12 and under attend free with a paying adult—making it easy and affordable for families to join the fun. *Minors are not permitted at the festival after 10:00 PM unless otherwise noted.*

The festival’s mission is to enhance the economic, cultural, and educational development of the community by promoting and preserving music.

**\#5 - The festival offers FREE dance lessons before and during the festival.** One feature that sets The South Coast Clambake Music Festival apart from other festivals is the FREE dance lessons that are open to both beginners and experienced dancers! From ballroom to swing, festival-goers can take part in free lessons led by professional instructors who generously volunteer their time to teach popular styles like the Foxtrot, West Coast Swing, and East Coast Swing. Leading up to the festival, additional dance workshops are often offered, giving attendees a head start on their steps before the music begins.

**\#7 - The festival took a 3-year hiatus during the pandemic.** The South Coast Clambake Music Festival took a three-year hiatus from 2020 to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the first extended pause in the event’s long history. During this period, organizers prioritized the health and safety of performers, attendees, and the community. The absence was felt deeply by both locals and longtime festival-goers, as the event had become a beloved tradition on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. In 2023, the festival made its much-anticipated return, bringing back its signature lineup of jazz, blues, and swing music, along with a renewed sense of excitement and connection for the community.

**\#8 - The festival venue is owned by the Coquille Indian Tribe and is an event hub on Oregon’s South Coast.** With over 500 employees, [The Mill Casino](https://www.themillcasino.com/) is one of the largest employers on Oregon’s South Coast. Located along the Coos Bay waterfront on the site of a former lumber mill, the casino is owned and operated by the Coquille Indian Tribe. It serves as a key economic driver for both the tribal community and the surrounding region, supporting tribal programs, education, and cultural preservation, while creating jobs for locals. Beyond gaming, The Mill Casino is a hub for entertainment and community gatherings, hosting concerts, festivals, and signature events like The South Coast Clambake Music Festival and the Mill-Luck Salmon Celebration.

**\#9 - In addition to bands from San Francisco and Portland, The South Coast Clambake Music Festival features local bands.** Festival-goers not only get to experience nationally recognized acts at the festival, but they also get to discover local bands from Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston. These hometown performers bring a unique flavor to the festival, celebrating the area’s rich musical heritage and highlighting the exceptional talent within the local community. Fan favorite [Shaymus Hanlin](https://clambakemusic.com/?page_id=4055) is based out of Portland, but the singer is originally from North Bend and got his start performing with local bands like [Oregon Coast Lab Band](https://www.facebook.com/coosevents/) and [Bay City Swing](https://www.facebook.com/baycityswing/?locale=hi_IN).

**\#10 - The Festival gives high school musicians a platform to perform.** High school bands from across Coos County are invited to perform at the festival venue on Friday morning, giving students a valuable opportunity to play before a live audience and learn from their peers. After their performance, band members enjoy a provided lunch—a time to connect with fellow young musicians. In support of local music education, The South Coast Clambake Music Festival also contributes financially to each participating school. These student performances, meals, and donations are made possible thanks to the generosity of festival sponsors and donors.

**\#11 - The first Southcoast Clambake Music Festival was held in 1988.** Originally known as the “Southcoast Dixieland Clambake Jazz Festival,” the festival dates back to the mid-1980s when a group of local musicians began discussing the idea of bringing a jazz festival to Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston. Members of the Coos Bay Clambake Jazz Band helped spearhead the effort, rallying support from the community. After two years of fundraising and planning, the first Southcoast Dixieland Clambake Jazz Festival debuted in 1988, kicking off what would become a beloved musical tradition on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

**\#12 - The festival hosts a Sunday Morning Gospel Service that is open to everyone.** The South Coast Clambake Music Festival’s Sunday morning gospel service, held in The Salmon Room at The Mill Casino, offers a spiritually uplifting close to the weekend.
