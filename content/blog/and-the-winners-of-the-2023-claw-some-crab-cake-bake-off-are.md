***Announcing the Results of the Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston Inaugural Crab Cake Baking Competition!***

You might have heard our announcement last spring about **Oregon's Adventure Coast**’s first-ever [<u>"Claw-some" Crab Cake Bake-Off</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/crab-cake-bake-off/). The inaugural cake-baking competition invited amateur and professional bakers to create a crab-inspired cake (bakery cakes, NOT actual crab dishes) for a chance to win a complimentary two-night stay on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston, with lodging, activities and some delicious dining options. Not to mention, bragging rights as Oregon's Adventure Coast's best crab cake baker! Each baker was asked to craft a crab-themed cake to represent **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston,** and document the process and the finished product.&nbsp;

The response was overwhelming! After dozens of entries featuring incredible and creative cakes, six judges had the nearly impossible task of selecting the winners in three categories: Professional, Amateur Adults, Amateur Kids. Each cake was judged for its creativity, ability to incorporate the theme, crab imagery and coastal style.&nbsp;

Without further adieu, the winning bakers and the names of their crustacean creations are as follows:&nbsp;

### **1st Place Winner Professional Bakers Category: Amy Bennette - *What the Crab?!***

\*Amy shared with us the meaning of her cake: *'What the Crab?!' is my quirky interpretation of a crab-themed cake, where a wizened old octopus finds that his dinner, a Dungeness Oregon Coast Crab, has escaped him.* All the elements of this amazing cake were edible.

### **1st Place Winner Amateur Category: Stacey Tigner- *Loy The Crab Feed Cake***

Stacey shared her experiences with us that inspired this amazing cake: *I'm originally from Eugene and ever since I can remember I would go crabbing with my grandparents up and down the Oregon Coast. I've had crab from all over and you still can't beat the dungeness and this is the best way to enjoy them and what inspired my cake.&nbsp; Newspaper laid out on the table with clarified butter and all you need to do is start cracking!&nbsp; I added the chowder and slaw to round out the coastal meal experience.*
