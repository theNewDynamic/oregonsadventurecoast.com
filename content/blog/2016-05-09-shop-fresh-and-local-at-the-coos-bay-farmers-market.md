## Farmers Market Shopping Tips

### **Plan Meals Ahead of Time**

When faced with the multitudes of choices and vendors in a farmers’ market, it’s easy to become overwhelmed. Plan your meals ahead of time and your trip to the market will be a fruitful one (pun intended).

### <strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Know Your Seasons</strong>

By knowing the agricultural seasons you’ll know what produce should be for sale at the farmers’ market and will be able to better plan the meals you’ll cook. Be sure to check a crop calendar ahead of time to know what produce will be available when (consider <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oce/weather/CropCalendars/" target="_blank">this handy one from the USDA</a>).

### Go Early or Go Late

With farmers’ markets, there are two optimal timings to visit. By going early you can avoid larger crowds and have the best selection to choose from. Popular goods may sell out throughout the day.

By going to farmers’ markets late you may find better deals. Typically vendors will prefer to sell of their goods at a discounted price rather than packing them up and taking them home. That said, please do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> ask for (or worse yet, demand) a discounted price. Just be polite and good things will typically happen.

### Bring Bags

Vendors may offer bags, but if you’re buying several pieces of produce and goods you’ll want to bring your own. Make sure you have a comfortable bag you can

### Bring Small Change

Though vendors will almost always have the required change you need, the transaction will go a lot quicker if you have exact change.

### <strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Get Advice</strong>

When in doubt, ask questions! These vendors specialize in their wares and produce. If you want to know the combination that will go best with what you’re cooking, what’s the optimal way to cook something, or just a good recommendation then be sure to ask! You’ll always get the help you’re looking for.
