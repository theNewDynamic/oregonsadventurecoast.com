Our Growing Food Culture Has Made Oregon’s Adventure Coast a True Haven for “Foodies”.

When you visit the Coos Bay/North Bend and Charleston area, you better come hungry! Not only will you find plenty of fresh wild caught seafood, visitors can enjoy deliciously unique meals in our [locally owned and operated restaurants](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/eat-drink/), often made from scratch by talented up and coming chefs any time of the year. You might say that our growing food culture has made Oregon’s Adventure Coast a true haven for foodies.

Now that Spring has officially sprung, this got us thinking about the abundance of wonderful food festivals happening throughout the spring and well into summer. So pack your bags, bring an appetite and prepare to “taste” the Oregon Coast.  Check our [Events Page](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/events/) for more information on these and other happenings along Oregon’s South Coast.
