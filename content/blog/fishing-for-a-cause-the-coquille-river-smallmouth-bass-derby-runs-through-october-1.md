***Participating in the Coquille River Smallmouth Bass Derby is a simple way to help protect and restore the precious ecosystems and native fish species on Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston.***

With seemingly limitless [bay and ocean fishing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay) opportunities, plus over [30 freshwater lakes and rivers](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/fresh-water-fishing-options-by-body-of-water) in Coos County alone, it's no mystery why [fishing on Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing/) is a favorite pastime for locals and visitors. But did you know that casting a line can also help protect the future of native fish, such as Chinook salmon, in their native river habitats?

The [<u>4th Annual Coquille River Smallmouth Bass Derby</u>](https://coquilleriverstepassoc.org/projects), running now through October 1, is more than a fishing competition. It's a season-long effort to protect native fish by removing an invasive predator, with the chance to earn some serious cash along the way.

Hosted by the [<u>Coquille River STEP Association</u>](https://coquilleriverstepassoc.org/) (Salmon and Trout Enhancement Program), this derby offers rewards from **$20 up to $1,000** for catching specially tagged smallmouth bass. You can fish from anywhere: a boat, a kayak, a paddleboard, or right off the bank of the Coquille River. It's free to enter, and every smallmouth bass you catch helps to support a healthier ecosystem.

Just bring your catch to one of the scanning stations in [<u>Sturdivant Park</u>](https://www.cityofcoquille.org/public_parks/sturdivant_park.php),[<u>Bryant Boat Ramp</u>](https://naturalatlas.com/boat-launches/bryant-1643534), or the Pioneer House in Powers to see if your fish is a winner.

### **Why It Matters**

![](/img/coquille-river-bass-derby-blog-695x322-3.jpg)

***Smallmouth bass are non-native to the Coquille River*** and have exploded in numbers over the past decade. Introduced illegally, these invasive predators outcompete and prey on native species, disrupting the river ecosystem and threatening the survival of juvenile fall Chinook salmon.

The [<u>Coquille River Watershed</u>](https://www.coquillewatershed.org/) is the largest river system in Oregon that originates from the Coast Range. It supports diverse wildlife and both recreational and commercial fishing in Coos County. When non-native species, such as smallmouth bass, overrun this system, they tip the balance, harming water quality and threatening the region's ecological resilience. Without action, these problems will only get worse. The Coquille River Smallmouth Bass Derby is one way to fight back.

### **A Grassroots Effort**

The Coquille River STEP Association is a volunteer-driven organization with deep roots in local conservation. In 2021, they launched the first Coquille River Smallmouth Bass Derby. The idea was simple: turn the community's love for fishing into an ecological solution by offering cash for every tagged bass caught.

Now in its fourth year, the derby continues to grow thanks to community support, funding from groups like the [<u>Coquille Indian Tribe</u>](https://www.coquilletribe.org/), and local business sponsors who can sponsor a fish for just $250.
