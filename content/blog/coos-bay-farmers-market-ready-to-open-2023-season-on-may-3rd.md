The market has a rich history and has been a fixture of the downtown Coos Bay community for years. What began as a small group of farmers and artisans who wanted to sell their products directly to the public in 1973, has grown into one of the most popular outdoor farmers markets on the Oregon Coast, offering fresh produce, baked goods, locally sourced seafood/meat, homemade crafts, jams/jellies and so much more!&nbsp; It has also become a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from all over the region who are interested in experiencing the local culture and cuisine.
