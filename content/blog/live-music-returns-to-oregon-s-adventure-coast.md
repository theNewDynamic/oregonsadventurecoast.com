**Music to Our Ears: The Oregon Coast Music Association Announces a Return to Live Music With OCMA Outdoors!**

It’s been a long, lonely, year without live performances, but thankfully organizations like the [Oregon Coast Music Association](http://www.oregoncoastmusic.org/) (OCMA) will finally provide us with relief this summer! Since 1979, the Oregon Coast Music Association has involved, enriched and inspired the community by providing quality classical music and creative musical experiences. However, like most organizations, the OCMA had to put their mission on hold during the pandemic.

The OCMA recently announced that orchestra members and community partners will present [outdoor musical festival events](https://www.oregoncoastmusic.org/) during the weekends of **July 17-18, 2021** and **July 24-25, 2021** (that is literally music to our ears)! Though this year’s events will be slightly different from the traditional performances associated with the Oregon Coast Music Festival (OCMF), the spirit of the festival will be as bright and beautiful as ever. In addition, the [Coos History Museum Plaza Stage](https://cooshistory.org/), a new venue, will be introduced to the community! Here’s a rundown of this year’s events:
