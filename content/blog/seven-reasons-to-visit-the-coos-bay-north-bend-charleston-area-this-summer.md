There’s always something happening on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, and the summer months are no exception! Not only is there typically plenty of sunshine and cooler temperatures to escape to, visitors can experience unique events, natural beauty and coastal views that can’t be found anywhere else in the country. Here are the top seven reasons why summer is one of our favorite seasons on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.&nbsp;

**\#1 Summer is a lovely time to explore the treasure-trove of** [**<u>Beaches</u>**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/)**,** [**<u>State Parks and National Lands</u>**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/) **on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.** No trip to Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston is complete without at least one journey along the [<u>Cape Arago Highway Loop</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/). In addition to breathtaking beaches and vantage points, this well traveled loop will take you to some of the best state parks in Oregon, including Sunset Bay State Park, Shore Acres State Park, and Cape Arago State Park. Whether you’re in the mood for a beach stroll, a bit of Forest Bathing in a coastal forest, wildlife viewing or searching for natural treasures in tide pools, this trip idea has it all! [<u>Download this guide</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/cape-arago-loop-itinerary.pdf)<u> </u>to help you on your route.

**\#2 Summer is a great time to go on a fun-filled fishing adventure!**&nbsp; Okay, it’s technically always a good time to go, but fishing off the Oregon Coast is hands down one of our favorite summertime adventures! Local tip: Before you head out on your fishing adventure, contact our local bait and tackle shops and ask for tips! It could save you time and money! [<u>Click here </u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing/)for more info.

**\#3- The Coos Bay Farmers Market is in full swing.** If you happen to be visiting mid-week, stop by the [<u>Coos Bay Farmers Market</u>](https://coosbaydowntown.org/farmers-market/)! The market operates every Wednesday from 9 am to 2 pm through October, and is located in the heart of the Coos Bay Downtown Historic District on Central Ave. The CBFM welcomes more than 60 vendors who provide the community with fresh, locally grown produce, eggs, honey, meat, baked goods, roasted coffee, flowers, body care products, handmade craft items, and more. Don’t miss the Food Truck Dining area for a quick bite to eat.&nbsp;

**\#4 Summer is a great time to experience the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.** For a truly unique Oregon coast adventure, go for a ride or hike in the [<u>Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/untamed-dunes/) This national treasure is the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America; 40 miles in all. Spinreel’s ever-popular [<u>Follow Me Tour</u>](https://www.ridetheoregondunes.com/follow-me-tour/) is a great option for first-time visitors.

**\#5 Visitors can explore Oregon's South Coast by kayak, stand-up paddleboard and more.** For the ultimate south coast adventure, it doesn’t get much better than fishing, wildlife viewing, and exploring the peaceful waterways on a guided kayak tour or paddleboard excursion along Oregon's South Coast. Don’t have your own kayak, paddleboard or surfboard? You can rent one and get some sage advice from our friends at [<u>Waxer’s Surf Shop</u>](https://waxerssurfandskate.com/) in downtown Coos Bay; [<u>Bahama Boards </u>](https://bahamaboardz.com/)in Coos Bay; and [<u>Coastal Kayak &amp; SUP Rentals</u>](https://coastalkayakandsuprentalsllc.com/) in the Empire District of Coos Bay. Coastal Kayak will even deliver your equipment where you plan to recreate! [<u>Click here</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/water-recreation/) for more info.

**\#6** **You have to see South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in the summer.&nbsp;**We can’t get enough of beautiful outdoor destinations, like t[<u>he South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (South Slough NERR)</u>](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx), a 5,000-acre natural area located in the Coos estuary near Charleston. Not only are there miles of hiking trails and waterways to explore, but visitors can also enjoy an abundance of wildlife viewing. Take a self-guided tour through this protected area of land and estuary, and you’ll likely spot various birds like Bald Eagles, Osprey, Great Blue Herons, Egrets and Belted Kingfishers.
