***Start planning your 2026 adventure and save money with our new*** [***<u>Local Vacation Loot promotion</u>***](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/loot/)***!***

If the past few years have taught us anything, it’s just how important it is to prioritize self-care and spend time with loved ones. However, we have a ways to go considering that in 2025, nearly two-thirds of workers felt [<u>more burned out than the year before</u>](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2025/02/08/job-burnout-at-66-in-2025-new-study-shows/), and millions of vacation days went unused as people found it hard to truly disconnect from work.​

Taking time off helps lower stress, burnout, and anxiety, and it’s good for your mental and physical health. With National Plan for Vacation Day (NPVD) coming up on January 27, 2026, we want to remind you that travel is not only good for your well-being, but it also helps our country’s economy.

### **How Travel Helps the Economy**

​Vacation travel helps local businesses by creating jobs and boosting the economy in places like **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston**. It can also improve job performance, productivity, and overall satisfaction.

The U.S. Travel Association says travel accounts for more than 2.5% of our national GDP and generates billions (yes, BILLIONS) of dollars in tax revenue. Their latest report says, “travel is essential to driving economic growth and job creation in states, destinations, and communities across America, and it is indispensable to our nation’s global competitiveness.”

​In 2024, travelers in the U.S. spent $1.3 trillion, which led to $2.9 trillion in total economic activity and supported over 15 million American jobs. Studies show that if Americans used their unused vacation days for travel, it could add over $151 billion in travel spending and create even more jobs. For the latest numbers, visit[<u>ustravel.org</u>](http://ustravel.org).

### **Why Travel is Good for Your Health**

![A hiker wearing a backpack stands on a forest trail with arms outstretched, surrounded by tall evergreen trees and lush greenery.](/img/take-a-vacation-in-2026-blog-940x788-1.jpg)

Many studies show that Americans are happier when they spend money on travel and experiences instead of things. Taking a vacation can help reduce depression, fatigue, stress, anxiety, and burnout, and it can boost your mood and outlook on life. These benefits also help your physical health.

### **Why Aren’t More People Taking Vacations?**

If vacations are so helpful, why aren’t more people taking them? Worries about job security, heavy workloads, and lack of coverage at work are common reasons Americans [<u>skip vacations</u>](https://www.newsweek.com/millions-of-americans-arent-taking-any-vacation-days-10966405).​ But, travel experts say that failing to plan ahead is one of the top reasons for unused vacation time. The [<u>U.S. Travel Association</u>](https://www.ustravel.org/) says people are more likely to use all their paid time off if they plan their vacation days at the start of the year. And there’s no better place to plan your Pacific Northwest getaway than **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston**.

### **Ok, I’m Convinced! Now What?**
