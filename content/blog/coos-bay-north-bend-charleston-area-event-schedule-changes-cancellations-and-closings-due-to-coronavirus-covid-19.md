**From the U.S. Forest Service** - **Campgrounds at the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area have been closed through April 14, 2020**, including Horsfall, Horsfall Beach, Spinreel, and Driftwood II. These campgrounds are unique in their design; rather than a typical family campground with individual sites separated by vegetation, these OHV campgrounds look more like parking lots where larger groups form tight circles of trailers and campers. During busy times, such as spring break weeks, these campgrounds often have a crowded, festival-like atmosphere. Existing reservations through April 14 have been canceled and fully refunded and new reservations before April 14 will not be accepted.

**Other Changes:** The following have slight changes to their normal operations.  
[**Josie's Art Lab**](https://www.facebook.com/Josies-Art-Lab-216155035404818/) - offering painting kits and online video instruction.  
[**The Pottery Company**](https://www.facebook.com/The-Pottery-Co-161842183873942/) - offering paint to-go pottery kits.

**As the developments in Coronavirus (COVID-19) continue to unfold, please follow the direction from our public health authorities including the** [**CDC**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)**,** [**Oregon Health Authority**](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/pages/index.aspx)**, and** [**Coos Health & Wellness**](https://cooshealthandwellness.org/) **to protect yourself, our community and our visitors.**

Our tourism industry is feeling the impact of this pandemic with cancellations of events and room nights. We encourage visitors and locals to enjoy our amenities, but also continue to take safety measures while doing so.

* Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
* Cover nose and mouth using bent elbow or a tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
* Practice social distancing of 3 feet when in small crowds.

We are closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as it relates to our state, our county and our destinations. **At this time, we have no confirmed cases in Coos County.**

**Our top priority is the safety, health, and well-being of our community, its residents, and visitors.** Federal public health officials have repeated frequently that it is safe for healthy people to travel in the U.S. We encourage the traveling public to seek and heed the latest expert guidance, and to make fact-based travel decisions.

This is a rapidly evolving situation that changes by the hour and there is a lot of uncertainty. We strongly encourage residents and travelers to always follow public health authoritiesâ€™ recommendations above all else.

**If you choose to travel, we welcome you. If you choose to stay home at this time, we look forward to seeing you in the future.**
