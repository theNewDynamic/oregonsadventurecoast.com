## A treasure trove of beautiful antiques and collectibles are waiting to be discovered on Oregon’s South Coast.

There is a reason why antique and treasure hunters head to the coast so frequently. The Coos Bay area has a rich and unique history, making this region an antique lovers playground. Many travelers who have passed through this area have expressed their genuine surprise about the wide selection and the quality of collectibles and antiques that are commonly found.

“We were in Coos Bay and ended up walking around looking at antique stores,” says one traveler. “I was not sure what to expect, but we were both delighted with the variety of stores in Coos Bay.”

While visiting downtown Coos Bay, an easy stroll along S. Broadway (Hwy 101) will lead you to six renowned antique shops like _The Gallery_ and _Antique & Collectibles-Coos_ under the Tioga Building, _Vintage 101_, _Old World Antiques_, _Antique & Auction Co. of Southern Oregon_, and _Leafs Treehouse Antiques & Collectibles_.

In North Bend you’ll find antiques, collectibles and second hand goods within 2 blocks on Highway 101 including _Fat Cat Antiques,_ _Beauty & The Beast_ (now only open on Saturdays from 11:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M), _The Mossy Rose, World Pawn Exchange, Pacific Antique_ _& Books, Comics Unlimited_ and _Simpkin’s Music Store._

You just never know what wonderful treasures you will find here, which makes Coos Bay a top destination for antique lovers. Here are just a few stores we’ve chosen to highlight in this post.
