Thinking about getting away from it all this fall or winter on [Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/adventures/)? Do it! No matter what season, studies have shown that taking a vacation has many positive benefits for mental health and productivity. Whether you’re here for the weekend or a week or two, the key to enjoying your adventure is to pack smart and plan ahead. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your Oregon Coast vacation!

## WHAT TO DO BEFORE YOU ARRIVE

❐ **Check the local, extended forecast.** This will help you decide what you will need to pack and what activities to plan for.

❐ **Request or download a** [**free visitors guide**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/#contactform) for inspiration and to help you discover the lay of the land.

❐ **Pack Smart.** If you are visiting in the fall & winter, dress in layers, as it allows you to adjust for temperature changes (dressing in layers is a smart idea any time of the year - but it’s advised for the cooler months). Your packing list might look something like this:

* A light, waterproof jacket - November, December and January are the wettest months, but a jacket with a hood is a year-round staple.
* Hiking boots (waterproof ones are the best) if you plan to hike and explore the outdoors.
* Warm hat.
* Jeans or long pants (we’re relaxed around here).
* Short sleeve and/or long sleeve t-shirts.
* Pull over sweatshirts and sweaters.
* Comfortable shoes - you’ll probably do a lot of walking.
* Multiple pairs of warm socks.
* Gear for specific activities you plan to do: i.e. waders for fishing or a wetsuit for surfing.
* Binoculars for viewing wildlife and marine mammals.
* Sunscreen (yes, even on a chilly or overcast day).
* A water bottle and snacks.
* A printed map (in case cell service is limited in some outdoor areas).
* Your Oregon’s Adventure Coast [visitors guide](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/#contactform) and restaurant guides (see below).
* Your Oregon State Park Annual Pass (if you have one). Some state parks charge a fee for access. Shore Acres State Park charges a $5/vehicle fee.

❐ **Visit the** [**Coos Bay Visitor Information Center**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/).

❐ **Take Lots of Photos.** Of course, you should always take that landscape shot so you can remember the beauty of Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston. However, you should also try to get in some of those photos yourself and your family! Most folks are willing to take your photo, and you’ll be grateful for the memories when you look back on these photos when you get older.

❐ **Try a New Restaurant.** Want to get a true sense of the Southern Oregon coast food & culture? Try one of the many [local restaurants on Oregon’s Adventure Coas](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/)t specializing in everything from fresh seafood (of course) to authentic Italian, Sushi, American Deli, Mexican, Thai and more - and that’s just on one city block! You will learn a lot about local culture, not to mention help support the economy, by eating locally. Ask locals for their recommendations and ask the server what their favorite item on the menu is.

❐ **Explore Local History and Culture.** Spend some time browsing the museums, galleries, and other cultural gems in our area, like the [Coos Art Museum,](http://www.coosart.org/) where visitors can view the rare personal items of champion runner Steve Prefontaine.
