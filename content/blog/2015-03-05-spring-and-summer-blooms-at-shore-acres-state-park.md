While the rest of the country has been staying home and social distancing, the glorious spring and summer blooms at Shore Acres State park haven't missed a beat. We would normally encourage you to pack your bags and head down to Oregon's Adventure Coast asap so you can see them for yourself- but this is not the time.

We know you hate to miss out on seeing the beautiful blooms in the [Shore Acres State Park](http://shoreacres.net) garden this time of year, we will do whatever we can to let you enjoy them from the comfort and safety of your own home this time.

First, a little history. What began as a luxurious private estate that belonged to lumber and shipping tycoon, Louis Simpson, has become a beloved local treasure featuring a “garden for all seasons” for anyone to enjoy. The original plantings of Shore Acres were designed to take advantage of our mild climate and featured exotic trees, shrubs, and flowering plants brought in from around the world by Simpson. The grounds contained five acres of formal gardens, including a Japanese-style garden built around a 100-foot lily pond to compliment Mr. Simpson’s elaborate home featuring a heated, indoor swimming pool and a large ballroom.

In 1942, Simpson’s beloved Shore Acres was purchased by the state of Oregon for use as a public park. Thanks to the help of thousands of Friends of Shore Acres volunteers, hundreds of rhododendrons, azaleas, daffodils along with thousands of tulips will bloom this spring. The garden also features thousands of flowering annuals/perennials and rose bushes through the summer along with dahlias in the fall.
