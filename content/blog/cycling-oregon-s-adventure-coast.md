### Grab your bikes and head to the Oregon Coast this fall!

[Live Culture Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/live-culture-coast/), a 10-day sensory celebration of fermentation, creativity & exploration of the Southern Oregon Coast, is kicking off right here in the Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston area October 18, 2019! The series of events celebrates the very best of Oregon's South Coast including world-class biking trails like the [Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trails](https://www.mtbproject.com/directory/8019222/whiskey-run-trails) and the [Wild Rivers Coast Scenic Bikeways](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/wild-rivers-coast-scenic-bikeway/).

Whether you are a seasoned cyclist or a casual rider, we encourage you to bring your bikes to the first-ever **Live Culture Coast** to enjoy the many options here ranging from flat surfaces to heart-pumping hills and trails. Here are some ideas and resources to help you plan Oregon's Adventure Coast for an epic cycling adventure this fall, or any time of the year.

**FUN FOR MOUNTAIN BIKERS**

**FUN OPTIONS FOR ROAD CYCLISTS**

[The Oregon Coast Bike Route (PDF).](https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Programs/TDD%20Documents/oregon-coast-bike-route-map.pdf)<br>
Following along US Highway 101, the Oregon Coast Bike Route attracts thousands of bicyclists. Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston is one of the areas where cyclists depart from the main highway and take a scenic detour along the rugged coastline on Cape Arago Loop and 7 Devils Road.

[City Bike Riding Trails Map (PDF).](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/FSCBW-BIKE-TRAIL-MAPS.pdf)<br>
Our friends at the Front Street Community Bike Works have put together a wonderful resource of cycling trail maps from no hills to daredevil!

**FAT BIKING DESTINATIONS**

One of the newest additions to the cycling world that we can't get enough of is the Fat Bike. What is a fat bike you might ask? Think of it as an off-road bicycle with oversized tires, typically 3.8 in or larger and wider rims designed to ride in softer terrain, like sand, snow, and mud.

So grab your bike and bring it down for a ride along the miles of Horsfall Beach and into The Dunes for a challenging experience. As Katy Bryce put it in her article, [*Fat Biking 100 Miles of Oregon Coast*](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/fat-biking/fat-biking-100-miles-of-oregon-coast), “Riding fat bikes is not just beach cruising! [The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://www.stateparks.com/oregon_dunes.html) provided us with the opportunity to shred hard in soft sand. Hike up. Slide down. Giggle. Repeat.” *Beware of* [*sneaker waves*](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PARKS/Pages/beach_safety.aspx) *and stay off rocks and small, enclosed beaches. Please be respectful and do not touch the wildlife nor the sensitive micro-environments you encounter.*
