"From rocky headlands to wide-open shores, agates, seabirds, tide pools and lighthouses in the distance, the Oregon Coast is a balm for the soul. Why ride it? Because its 363 miles of glorious coastline are full of wonder, largely car-free and accessible for us all." - Jen Anderson, Travel Oregon

[Live Culture Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/live-culture-coast/), a 10-day sensory celebration of fermentation, creativity & exploration of the Southern Oregon Coast, is kicking off right here in the Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston area October 18, 2019!

Following along US Highway 101, the Oregon Coast Bike Route attracts thousands of bicyclists.

**FAT BIKING DESTINATIONS**

One of the newest additions to the cycling world that we can't get enough of is the Fat Bike. What is a fat bike you might ask? Think of it as an off-road bicycle with oversized tires, typically 3.8 in or larger and wider rims designed to ride in softer terrain, like sand, snow, and mud. 

So grab your bike and bring it down ride along the miles of Horsfall Beach and into The Dunes for a challenging experience. As Katy Bryce put it in her article, [_Fat Biking 100 Miles of Oregon Coast_](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/fat-biking/fat-biking-100-miles-of-oregon-coast), “Riding fat bikes is not just beach cruising! [The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area](https://www.stateparks.com/oregon_dunes.html) provided us with the opportunity to shred hard in soft sand. Hike up. Slide down. Giggle. Repeat.” _Beware of_ [_sneaker waves_](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PARKS/Pages/beach_safety.aspx) _and stay off rocks and small, enclosed beaches. Respect the sensitive micro-environments, whether it’s birds or anenome you encounter._
