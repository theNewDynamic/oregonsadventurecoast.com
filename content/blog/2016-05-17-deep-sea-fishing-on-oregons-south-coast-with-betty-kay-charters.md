## “Captain Bill was wonderful, going out of his way to find a good fishing spot and track down a whale for us.”

Deep sea fishing along Oregon’s South Coast is one of the great experiences to be had any time of the year. Few things are more relaxing than chartering a boat and heading out onto the beautiful and mysterious Pacific waters on a fishing excursion.

There are several <a href="/featured-adventures/fishing-crabbing-clamming/" target="_blank">Charter Boat Fishing companies</a> on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, though <a href="http://www.bettykaycharters.com/" target="_blank">Betty Kay Charters</a> is perhaps the most well known and recommended in our area.

For the last thirty years Captains Bill and Kathi have taken anglers of all skill levels on countless experiences including whale watching and deep sea fishing for halibut, salmon, rock fish, and tuna. It’s this level of experience that makes them the top choice for fishing off the Oregon Coast. “Amazing time with friends,” says one of their happy customers on a recent <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51801-d7910125-Reviews-Betty_Kay_Charter-Charleston_Oregon.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor.com</a> review. “Captain Bill was wonderful, going out of his way to find a good fishing spot and track down a whale for us. Jacob, the deckhand, was helpful, funny, and very knowledgeable about the area, it’s history and sea life. He made fishing a successful experience for the kids, and explained lots about the fish they were catching.”

This season, Captain Kurt and Captain Bill will be taking passengers out while Captain Kathy recovers from an ankle injury. Your fishing trip will take you over kelp pads, reefs and pinnacles which hold a rich habitat for the wide varieties of bottom fish you will catch!

If you’re new to deep sea fishing, the Betty Kay Charters crew will assist you with the basics and will go out their way to make your excursion as simple and enjoyable as possible. “If you’ve never been ocean fishing and always wanted to try it this is who you want to go with,” says another review on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51801-d7910125-Reviews-Betty_Kay_Charter-Charleston_Oregon.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor.com</a>. “It’s great fun for kids and adults alike and to see the look on your child’s face when they bring up a fish is priceless.”

Now is the time to book your summer 2016 deep sea fishing trip! The summer season is underway and the crew is looking forward to great salmon trips, halibut fishing and the thrills of off shore tuna fishing. “We will be ready for great catches of the albacore tuna and high adventure for you ocean fishers!”
