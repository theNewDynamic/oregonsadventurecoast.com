North Bend, Oregon is home to some of our area’s most beloved natural attractions as well as a lovely downtown filled with unique quaint shops, antique stores and restaurants. Since it turns 117 this month, we thought this would be the perfect time to shine a spotlight on this welcoming community on Oregon’s Adventure Coast!

First, a little history. The City of North Bend was founded in 1903 by shipping tycoon Louis .J. Simpson and was named to reflect its location on the north bend of the Coos bay. Though the city is 117 years old, it had been occupied by multiple Native American communities for thousands of years before European settlers arrived 400 years ago. Today, North Bend is home to the [Coquille Indian Tribe's ](https://www.coquilletribe.org/)government and home to the famous [McCullough Memorial Bridge](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51813-d4725395-Reviews-McCullough_Memorial_Bridge-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html) which has been placed on the [National Register of Historic Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places) in recognition of its design and cultural and economic importance.

What to do in North Bend? Whether you’re seeking adventure, nightlife, shopping or just want to unwind, you’re sure to enjoy your time here. The area brims with stunning landscapes and amazing activities and attractions for kids and adults alike. While we can’t list EVERYTHING to do in this post, here are a few highlights you might want to consider this summer:

**Explore North Bend’s Historic Downtown**
To get a true feel for North Bend’s unique history, head to the [North Bend Information Center](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/) before embarking on a [historic walking tour of North Bend](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/historic-walking-tour-of-north-bend/). On your tour, feel free to browse the unique local shops like [Painted Zebra](https://www.facebook.com/paintedzebraboutique), [Petal to the Metal](http://www.petaltothemetalflowers.com/), [Books by the Bay](https://www.facebook.com/Books-By-The-Bay-232314893488700), [Josies Art Lab](https://www.facebook.com/Josies-Art-Lab-216155035404818/), Fat Cat Antiques, Mossy Rose, and many others.

**Ride the Oregon Dunes**
No visit to North Bend would be complete without an adventure on the Oregon Dunes. We have the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America- perfect for camping, off-road ATVing, sandboarding and hiking. The largest riding area on the Oregon Dunes is between Spinreel Campground and Horsfall Road, just a few miles north of North Bend and Coos Bay. Vehicles are available to rent with advanced reservations.

**A Picnic at [Simpson Park](https://kcby.com/news/local/new-playground-at-simpson-park-in-north-bend-its-a-good-place-for-kids)**
This popular park was named after North Bend’s founder, Louis .J. Simpson and known for its superb scenic views and its close proximity to the bay. It features a playground, a covered picnic area and restrooms, and is perfect for families looking for a picturesque lunch break. Simpson Park is also home to [Oregon’s Merci Train BoxCar](http://mercitrain.org/Oregon/). After World War II, ‘’Forty and Eight’’ or ‘’French Gratitude Train’’ cars were given to the U.S. to show France’s gratitude for the help received during the war and seal the French-American friendship.

**Run wild at the [Mill Casino](https://www.themillcasino.com/)**
Looking for some thrilling casino action? Or perhaps you’re simply after an entertaining evening? The Mill Casino has your back! The newly reopened casino has implemented stringent sanitation and social distancing protocols to keep visitors safe so you can relax while you play. You’ll find more info[ here](https://www.themillcasino.com/).

**Reset in nature on the [North Spit Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/de/trail/us/oregon/north-spit-trail)**
Located only 3 away from North Bend, this hiking trail requires a moderate level of fitness and offers visitors spectacular views. It would be the ideal day trip if you’re up for a walk along the beautiful Oregon coast. Spanning from open sand dunes and, wetlands to, and forested islands, the incredible landscapes will take your breath away. If you’re a beach lover, you’ll enjoy your time walking along unspoilt unspoiled beaches stretching over miles. Fantastic memories guaranteed!

The best time to visit is between May and October. However, if you visit during winter and if you’re lucky to arrive after a storm, chances are you’ll be able to see the Sujameco shipwreck which sank in 1929 as storms sometimes reveal the ship due to shifting sands. The Sujameco was the victim of treacherous weather as it was trying to cross Coos Bay bar on a stormy night of March 1929 and is one of several shipwrecks on the Oregon Coast. You’ll find more info [here](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/north-spit-trail?u=m).

**Enjoy bird spotting on the [Bluebill Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=71108)**
This is an excellent spot if you’re looking for peace and quiet, love wildlife spotting and enjoy lush nature walks. The trail loops around a stunning lake and will take you through salal bushes, grassy meadow areas and shoreline forests. The area harbors a lot of hummingbirds along with multiple species of fish, insects and other birds. More information about the trail [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recarea/?recid=42649).

**Watch the sunset on a beach**
Coquille point, Bastendorff Beach and Devil’s Kitchen are all beautiful spots to sit back, relax and enjoy the sunset at the end of a busy day. Why not even bring a picnic so you can gaze upon the stars whilst listening to the relaxing sound of waves crashing on the beach?
