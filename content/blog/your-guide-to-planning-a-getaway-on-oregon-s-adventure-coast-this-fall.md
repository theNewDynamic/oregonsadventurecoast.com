If you are looking for a special Oregon Coast getaway this fall or winter, we have an opportunity for you! Last month, we announced our [<u>15% Fall Lodging Savings Special,</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fall15/) where visitors can save on lodging at participating hotel properties on [<u>Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston,</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/adventures/) and the timing could not be better for many Pacific Northwest travelers. Not only is autumn one of our favorite seasons here on the Oregon Coast, but a quick autumn getaway is sometimes just what a person needs to boost their health and productivity before the busy holiday season kicks in.&nbsp;

Whether you’re here for the weekend or a week, the key to enjoying your adventure this fall is to pack smart and plan ahead. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your Oregon Coast vacation!

**HOW TO PLAN YOUR FALL GETAWAY**

❐ **Request or download a**[**<u>free visitors guide</u>**](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/#contactform) for inspiration and to help you discover the lay of the land.

**❐ Figure out where to go while you are visiting.** With so many travel adventures, deciding on what to do during your visit should be a priority. You can customize the trip based on your personal preferences. During the autumn months, visitors can experience everything from [<u>epic hiking trails</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking) with sweeping views to [<u>casino gaming,</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/gaming) along with [<u>mountain biking</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/cycling), [<u>fishing</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing), [<u>crabbing</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/crabbing-clamming), [<u>clamming</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/clamming), [<u>riding the Oregon Dunes</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/atv-motorsports), [<u>beach combing &amp; tide pooling</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/ocean-life-and-tidepooling/), [<u>storm watching</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/storm-watching) (when weather permits), exploring the unique [<u>art, history and culture</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/art-history-culture) that makes Oregon’s Adventure Coast such a special destination, and [<u>more</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/adventures/).

Travel platforms like [<u>Tripadvisor</u>](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g51813-Activities-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html), [<u>Travel Oregon</u>](https://traveloregon.com/places-to-go/cities/coos-bay/) and [<u>roadtrippers.com</u>](https://roadtrippers.com/) are great resources for ideas and road trip recommendations.

❐ **Figure out where to eat.** In addition to maps and travel itineraries, print these dining guides and take them with you for quick and easy decision making when hunger strikes! You can also do a little research on the best eats on our [<u>Dining Page</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/).&nbsp;

* [<u>Oregon’s Adventure Coast Local Restaurant &amp; Dining Guide</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/restaurants-booklet-web-09-23.pdf)
* [<u>Guide to Coffee Shops, Bakeries, &amp; Specialty Shops on Oregon’s Adventure Coast</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/coffeeshops-bakery-08-23.pdf)

❐ **Pack Smart.** If you are visiting in the fall & winter, dress in layers, as it allows you to adjust for temperature changes (dressing in layers is a smart idea any time of the year - but it’s advised for the cooler months). Your packing list might look something like this:

* A light, waterproof jacket - November, December and January are the wettest months, but a jacket with a hood is a year-round staple.
* Hiking boots (waterproof ones are the best) if you plan to hike and explore the outdoors.
* Warm hat.
* Jeans or long pants (we’re relaxed around here).
* Short sleeve and/or long sleeve t-shirts.
* Pull over sweatshirts and sweaters.
* Comfortable shoes - you’ll probably do a lot of walking.
* Multiple pairs of warm socks.
* Gear for specific activities you plan to do: i.e. waders for fishing or a wetsuit for surfing.
* Binoculars for viewing wildlife and marine mammals.
* A water bottle and snacks.
* A printed map (in case cell service is limited in some outdoor areas).
* Your Oregon’s Adventure Coast[<u> visitors guide</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/Oregon-Coast-Visitor-Guide.pdf) and restaurant guides (see above).
* Your Oregon State Park Annual Pass (if you have one). Some state parks charge a fee for access. Shore Acres State Park charges a $5/vehicle parking fee all year long.

❐ **Last but definitely not least, learn these potentially lifesaving safety guidelines** to keep you, your family and/or pets safe while you’re near the water. Our quiet, peaceful,[<u>undeveloped beaches</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches) are ideal for long walks, hiking, photography, picnicking, and tide-pooling. However, it is important that all Oregon Coast visitors understand potential risks near the water and follow these very important [<u>safety guidelines</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/eight-ways-to-stay-safe-on-the-beaches-along-the-oregon-coast). Check the tide times at[<u>tides-forecast.com</u>](https://www.tide-forecast.com/regions/Oregon).
