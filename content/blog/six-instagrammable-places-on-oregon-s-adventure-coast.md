GUEST POST BY: KRISTINA PHELAN

The Oregon Coast is one of the most picture-perfect places for that spring and summer get-away. You’ll find plenty of activities as well as some of the best fresh seafood you’ve ever tasted! Check out these most Instagrammable spots on Oregon’s South Coast.

    #1-Sunset Bay State Park

Sunset Bay is one of a trio of parks located just south of Coos Bay just half a mile away for the Cape Arago lighthouse. Shore Acres, Cape Arago, and Sunset Bay all offer campsites, interesting yurts and plenty of hiking trails to keep you busy for a day in the forest. But Sunset Bay may be the most picturesque view for your trip. It’s no wonder the beaches and parks in Oregon rank in the top ten on LawnStarter’s best places to camp list. Check out the natural beauty of the coastal forests as well as the gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean from the vistas along the trails.

\#2-FISHERMEN’S SEAFOOD MARKET

You’ll find this quaint little restaurant in Coos Bay that offers up some of the most delicious clam chowders along the Oregon Coast! People who visit say the fish and chips are amazing. You can sit outside on a nice day or choose an inside spot if your day at the beach has been rained out. Many locals take food to go as well. Take a picture of your fresh seafood at this little hidden- away gem.

\#3-THE OREGON DUNES NATIONAL RECREATION AREA

The dunes that separate the water from the inland are unique. Many outfitters rent dune buggies to visitors who want to explore the area with a dose of adrenaline. You’ll find these areas to be Instagram-worthy with their distinctive sandy complexion. Record a quick video for your Instagram feed as well to show others how much fun you’re having on the Oregon Coast.

\#4-OREGON COAST HISTORIC RAILWAY MUSEUM

This renowned museum features many preserved and restored locomotives and other logging equipment. The building is large enough to actively restore the artifacts and equipment that helped to make the Oregon Coast what it is today. You’ll find plenty of information regarding the use of the trains as well as interesting facts about the logging industry that’s still prevalent in the area. Take a picture of the beautiful 1922 Baldwin steam locomotive or the Southern Pacific caboose, two signature pieces of the museum.

\#5-MCCULLOUGH MEMORIAL BRIDGE

This beautiful bridge is magnificent in its size and intricate detail. The McCullough Memorial Bridge was built in 1936 and spans an area of over one mile long in Coos Bay. Quite an engineering feat for its time since it was the longest and the underlying waterways had to remain open during construction. It also helped create many jobs during The Great Depression. The bridge still stands today as the main thoroughfare throughout the Coos Bay area for motorists, bikers, and pedestrians.

\#6-BASTENDORFF BEACH

What’s a trip to the Oregon Coast without a visit to the beach? Bastendorff Beach in Charleston is a great spot to relax and listen to the ocean. This large sandy beach area is also great for families who want to build a sandcastle or hunt for treasures. You’ll spot a variety of birds and crabs making their way to the ocean. Pack a picnic lunch and snap a picture of this beautiful beach for your Insta followers.
