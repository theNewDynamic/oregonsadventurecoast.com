The annual “crab alanche” seafood fundraiser, organized by the[Charleston Merchants Association](https://www.facebook.com/discovercharlestonoregon), brings hundreds of crab fans together at the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology for a delicious feast you will never forget. Roughly 900 pounds of fresh Dungeness crab are served each year, caught by local fishermen out of Charleston and prepared by the team at [Chuck’s Seafood](https://www.chucksseafood.com/). Proceeds from the event help support the [Charleston Visitor Center](https://www.facebook.com/discovercharlestonoregon/).

“This annual tradition has been bringing people together for over four decades,” said Janice Langlinais, Executive Director of the Coos Bay-North Bend-Charleston Visitor and Convention Bureau. “Hundreds of visitors from all over Oregon travel here to gather with our community, savor fresh local Dungeness crab, and show support for the merchants and families that make Charleston’s fishing community so special.”

​Guests can enjoy whole or half Dungeness crab at market price, served with side dishes and a roll. If you don’t eat crab, a gourmet hot dog lunch with sides will also be offered.

Guests will have the opportunity to learn more about local marine life and conservation from South Slough Estuary and the Oregon Crab Commission. And of course, don’t forget to enter for a chance to win raffle prizes generously donated by businesses throughout Charleston, Coos Bay, and North Bend! ​

Ticket prices are based on market value. [Get your tickets now](https://charlestonoregon.org/events#1abd198d-4f1c-4af7-9588-71a2c9c4af85).
