The historic tall ships, Lady Washington and the Hawaiian Chieftain, will soon set sail for the Coos Bay Boardwalk where they will dock May 1st- 6th! The Lady Washington is a full-scale reproduction of the original Lady Washington, the first American vessel to make landfall on the west coast of North America in 1788. The Hawaiian Chieftain is a replica of a typical early nineteenth-century European merchant ship. Her hull shape and rigging are similar to the ships used by Spanish explorers during the 18th-century expeditions of the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.

This is an exciting opportunity for the whole family to experience and learn about maritime history during the walk-on tours of the ships (for a suggested donation of $5 per person) and educational programs for all.

The tall ships are always a treat, but we invite our visitors to get out and explore the unique destinations that make Oregon’s Adventure Coast an exceptional region. Here are some tips to help you enjoy the very best of Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston, Oregon during your visit.

**#1. Visit the Beaches and State Parks Along the Cape Arago Highway Beach Loop.** No Oregon's Adventure Coast trip is complete without at least one visit to the beaches and State Parks along the Cape Arago Highway Loop. The Cape Arago Beach Loop will take you to three state parks (Sunset Bay State Park, Shore Acres State Park, and  Cape Arago State Park) in addition to breathtaking beaches and vantage points. Take a walk and watch the surfers on Bastendorff Beach or search for natural treasures in tidepools in the protected beach in Sunset Bay State Park. We recommend grabbing binoculars and taking some time to explore the Simpson Reef and nearby Shell Island to view and listen to the seals and sea lions.

Shore Acres State Park, the crown jewel of Oregon's South Coast, is not to be missed. Take a scenic stroll along the breathtaking cliffs with majestic ocean views. Be sure to visit their famous gardens for a closer look at their stunning blooms.
