**About the Trails:** The [Oregon Coast Visitors Association](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/travel-guides/mountain-biking-for-all-at-whiskey-run/) describes Whiskey Run as “fast, flowy, loamy, and fun,” offering a true year-round mountain biking experience with something for everyone. Riders can choose from short, easy loops to challenging downhill routes, with the trails offering a blend of flow and cross-country style. Clear sightlines, gentle climbs, and adrenaline-pumping jumps keep both beginners and advanced riders entertained. Plus, the trails come with playful names like [The Snag](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/the-snag/), [Dirty Dishes](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/dirty-dishes/), [Hollerback](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/hollerback-trail/), [Sour Mash](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/sour-mash-lower/), [White Lightning](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/white-lightning-131363/), [Bootlegger](https://www.trailforks.com/trails/bootlegger-112030/) and one of our favorites, [Gnome Wrecker](https://www.trailforks.com/video/67378/)! In addition to the spectacular trails, Whiskey Run treats riders to sweeping ocean views and lush coastal forests of spruce and Douglas fir.

**Best Time to Ride:** Whiskey Run’s well-maintained trails allow riders to enjoy the system in a variety of weather conditions. While late spring through early fall is the ideal riding season, a few dry days in winter can also provide peak trail conditions. Unlike many Oregon trails that close due to harsh weather, the temperate coastal climate of **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston**—draws mountain bikers year-round from across the Pacific Northwest and across the county.

**How to Check Conditions:** The trail system is professionally built to withstand coastal weather, though it’s best to avoid riding when the trails are muddy. We encourage visitors to always check trail reports or contact local shops and guide services for current conditions by contacting the folks at [Wild Rivers Coast Mountain Biking Association](https://wrcmba.com/) at [info@wrcmba.com](mailto:info@wrcmba.com) (they usually respond within 1 business day). [Moe's Bike Shop](https://www.facebook.com/p/Moes-Bike-Shop-100057227899293/) (North Bend, Oregon), [Blue Sky Bike Shop](https://www.blueskybikeshop.com/) (Coos Bay) and [South Coast Bicycles](https://southcoastbicycles.com/) (Bandon) are also great resources for visitors to contact regarding trail conditions at Whiskey Run. Riders may want to familiarize themselves with [Trailforks](https://www.trailforks.com/region/whiskey-run-trails-21273/), especially during the rainy season, as they share timely updates. The platform offers invaluable interactive maps featuring trail distances, suggested route connections, and detailed elevation profiles, making it an essential tool for any mountain biking adventure.

**How to Get There:** Located just 17 minutes south of Coos Bay off Highway 101, Whiskey Run is conveniently situated between Coos Bay and Bandon on the Oregon’s South Coast. To get there, take Highway 101 South from Coos Bay and turn onto Beaver Hill Road to access the system from the upper trailhead. Alternatively, you can head east on Whiskey Run Road from Seven Devils Road, between Bandon and Charleston on the Oregon Coast Bike Route, for access from the lower parking lot.
