The outstanding service and food experienced by restaurant patrons in our local dining establishments are one of the best kept secrets on Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast. Foodies from all over the region have told us time and time again how surprised they were in the quality and the selection of the restaurants in our area.

We&#8217;re not surprised at all. In downtown Coos Bay alone, hungry travelers can find top notch Sushi, Thai, Italian, Mexican, Local Fish and American comfort food within blocks of each other! We asked around to find out what the favorite restaurants are among visitors, and thought we&#8217;d pass this info along to you.

Here are some Coos Bay restaurants worth checking out in 2016. _ Don&#8217;t worry- we&#8217;re highlighting the best restaurants in North Bend and Charleston next!_

###  <a href="http://www.littleitalycb.com/" target="_blank">Little Italy </a>

In the mood for a taste of Italy? You can&#8217;t go wrong at Little Italy, ranked #1 for Coos Bay restaurants [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g51813-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html). Frequent visitors praise the restaurant for it&#8217;s outstanding service, food, and cozy ambiance. For a real treat try the Osso Bucco, gnocchi pesto and another reviewer says that their Fettuccine Alfredo was the creamiest, smoothest they&#8217;ve ever tasted!

One visitor from Washington posted that Little Italy is a &#8220;must&#8221; for dining whenever they visit the area. &#8220;During this last trip we had dinner there twice and had lunch also. The lunch menu was as wonderful as dinner,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The food here has always been marvelous. A real taste of Italy. It&#8217;s hard to eat Italian anywhere else after eating here&#8221;.

### <a href="http://www.citysubs1.com/" target="_blank">City Subs</a>

If you like sandwiches, (and who doesn&#8217;t?) this is a great place to fuel up in Coos Bay. City Subs is one of the top ranked restaurants in Coos Bay for a reason. Known for their freshly baked homemade bread, generous portions (they don&#8217;t skimp on the good stuff) and very friendly service. &#8220;Truly as good as it gets! The fresh baked good is flavorful and light, you don&#8217;t get more bread than ingredients,&#8221; raved a recent visitor on <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/city-subs-coos-bay" target="_blank">Yelp</a>. &#8220;Wow. That was full of exceptional Nom. Fresh baked homemade bread. Fresh ingredients. Fast service,&#8221; said another.

&#8220;I watched how the staff interacted with their customers, and it was clear that City Subs is a place where the locals eat, where everyone knows everyone,&#8221; another visitor recently posted. We recommend stopping in and try their pastrami melt while answering some Coos Bay trivia at your table.

### <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/fishermens-seafood-market-coos-bay" target="_blank">Fishermen’s Seafood Market</a>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>“Great food that is always fresh!”<br /> &#8220;BEST fish and chips&#8221;<br /> “Surprise! Best meal of my trip”<br /> “Freshest Fish Anywhere”</strong>
</p>

Need we say more? This floating fish market, famous for their made-from-scratch clam chowder, can be found off the Coos Bay City Docks. The dinning area is very small and tends to feel more like a carry out counter with a few seats, but the food is worth it! Their fish case is filled with fresh seafood they caught themselves or purchased directly from local fishing boats. Try one of their baskets, featuring hand cut and breaded rock fish, clams (harvested by them), prawns and oysters.

### <a href="http://www.tokyocoosbay.com/" target="_blank">Tokyo Bistro</a>

Visitors can&#8217;t stop raving about this local gem, known for very fresh Sushi and tasty Tempura. One reviewer says &#8220;top notch, serving great food. I&#8217;ve never been disappointed in the service.&#8221;

Hot tip: &#8220;Tucked behind the Bistro is Edna&#8217;s Bakery, not to be missed! Edna has been baking for years and supplying local restaurants with baked goods. Give them a try, you won&#8217;t be disappointed.

### <a href="http://www.blueheronbistro.net/" target="_blank">Blue Heron Bistro</a>

In the mood for something unique? We hear the German Cuisine and romantic charm at the Blue Heron Bistro is an experience worth trying. This is a great place to cap off a day of exploring with a brew from their extensive beer menu with lots of options. &#8220;The authentic German cuisine is cooked to absolute perfection in every regard, from the sausage to the sauerkraut,&#8221; posted one <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-blue-heron-bistro-coos-bay" target="_blank">enthusiastic Yelp reviewer</a>. &#8220;I can affirmatively recommend The Blue Heron Bistro for any tourist, including myself on future visits! Five stars well earned!&#8221;

Oh, and save room for dessert!
