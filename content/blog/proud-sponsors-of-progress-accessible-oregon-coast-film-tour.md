When we work together, we can accomplish great things. This spring, we celebrated just that: a powerful reminder of how collaboration, community, and shared purpose can pave the way toward a more accessible and inclusive future on the Oregon Coast.

**Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** was proud to be a local sponsor of the<a href="https://visittheoregoncoast.com/industry-news/thats-a-wrap-on-the-accessible-oregon-coast-film-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em><u>Accessible Oregon Coast Film Tour</u></em></a>, an inspiring series of events presented by <a href="https://visittheoregoncoast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oregon Coast Visitors Association (OCVA)</a> that brought together accessibility advocates, tourism leaders, and Oregon Coast communities to spotlight progress and ignite new ideas. The tour showcased three powerful short films created by<a href="https://www.glpfilms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <u>GLP Films</u></a> and funded by<a href="https://traveloregon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <u>Travel Oregon</u></a>, each highlighting the people and partnerships making the Oregon Coast more inclusive for everyone.

Last month, we were proud to host the premiere of *The Accessible Oregon Coast Film Tour* at <a href="https://www.egyptiantheatre.events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coos Bay's historic Egyptian Theatre</a>. It was a powerful afternoon of testimonials and honest conversations about access, inclusion, and what it takes to build a truly welcoming destination.

### **A Commitment to Inclusion on Oregon's South Coast**

![](/img/accessible-oregon-coast-film-tour-blog-695x322-3.jpg)

For us, accessibility isn't just a feature; it's an investment in the future of our region. Our sponsorship of the *Accessible Oregon Coast Film Tour* reflects our ongoing commitment to accessibility and inclusion across the Southern Oregon Coast. Over the past few years, tourism stakeholders across our region have worked with partners like the OCVA and <a href="https://wheeltheworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wheel the World</a> to ensure that the Oregon Coast is a place where everyone, regardless of ability, can experience its natural beauty, outdoor adventure, and welcoming communities.

The tour highlighted $1.5 million in tourism-funded accessibility projects, the voices of 24 lived-experience panelists, and the efforts of more than 40 organizations across 475 miles of coastline. But it was more than just a celebration; it was a call to action.

### **Real Change, Right Here**

In our own backyard, progress is visible and growing. Through partnerships with organizations like Wheel the World, several local businesses have completed accessibility assessments and now proudly display their "Accessibility Verified" status. Visitors can find guides like <a href="https://blog.wheeltheworld.com/where-to-stay-and-what-to-do-in-coos-bay-and-their-accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coos Bay Accessibility Insights: Where to Stay and What to Do,</a> giving travelers with mobility challenges the tools they need to confidently explore our region.

Thanks to the generous support of local organizations, <a href="https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/oregon-s-adventure-coast-boosts-accessibility-for-outdoor-recreation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David's Chair Outdoor Mobility Systems</a> is now available to reserve and use for free. These rugged, track-based chairs empower individuals with mobility challenges to access beaches and trails, places that once felt out of reach. From accessible kayak launches at <a href="https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William M. Tugman State Park</a> and <a href="https://www.coosbayor.gov/community/city-parks/john-topits-park-empire-lakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Topits Park </a>to accessible viewing platforms, our communities are coming together to build an environment where everyone is welcome and no one is left behind.

### **Why It Matters**

According to this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0716-Adult-disability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> in July of 2024, more than **70 million U.S. adults report having a disability.** In 2024 alone, travelers with disabilities took nearly 77 million trips and spent nearly $50 billion. That's not just a market, it's a movement.

With 70% of Baby Boomers planning trips in 2025, and nearly half of those aged 65+ reporting a disability, accessible travel isn't just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do.

We're proud that Oregon's Adventure Coast is part of this momentum. Together with our community and coastal partners, we're working to remove barriers and open doors so that every traveler can experience the adventure, serenity, and magic that define the Southern Oregon Coast.

### **Looking Ahead**

The *Accessible Oregon Coast Film Tour* was more than a showcase of what's been accomplished. It was a spotlight on what's possible when people come together with a shared vision. At Oregon's Adventure Coast, we're not stopping here. We'll continue to advocate, invest, and collaborate so that every visitor can experience the full wonder of Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston.
