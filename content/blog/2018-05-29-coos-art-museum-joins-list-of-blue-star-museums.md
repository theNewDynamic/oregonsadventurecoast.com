Coos Art Museum is one of more than 2,000 museums across America to offer free admission to military personnel and their families this summer in collaboration with the National Endowment for the Arts, Blue Star Families, and the Department of Defense.

The Coos Art Museum has announced their participation in Blue Star Museums, a collaboration among the National Endowment for the Arts, Blue Star Families, the Department of Defense, and more than 2,000 museums across America to offer free admission to the nation’s active duty military personnel and their families. The program runs from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day, September 3, 2018. It provides families an opportunity to enjoy the nation's cultural heritage and learn more about their community, especially after a military move. A list of participating museums is available at<span class="m_6388000029967042370Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://arts.gov/bluestarmuseums" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://arts.gov/bluestarmuseums&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527700471511000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2trbz1wl6Gl-slrAt2ANMWFygqg">arts.gov/bluestarmuseums</a>.<span class="m_6388000029967042370Apple-converted-space"> </span>

“Visiting a museum is a great way to get to know a community—whether it’s in your hometown or a stop on a road trip,” said NEA Chairman Jane Chu. “We appreciate the enthusiasm of museums all across the country who open their doors for military and their families to spend time together and have new arts experiences.”
