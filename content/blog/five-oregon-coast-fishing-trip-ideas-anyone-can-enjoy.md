We’ve said it before, but we’ll say it again. Fishing is more than just a way to pass the time on&nbsp; **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston**…it’s deeply ingrained into our collective culture and history. For thousands of years, an abundance of freshwater lakes and rivers, along with the bay and ocean, has sustained the way of life for residents on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, dating back to the [<u>Coquille Indian Tribe</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tribal-heritage-coquilles/) and [<u>Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Siuslaw and Lower Umpqua Indians</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tribal-heritage-confederated/), long before the first European settlers ever arrived in the region. Centuries later, our area is still a prime destination for all sorts of fishing adventures - whether it’s from the shore, charter boat, jetty, dock, and even by kayak.&nbsp;

Whether you’re looking for a fishing adventure for the very first time or the 1000th time, we are here to help you plan. In this post, we’ve put together some of our fishing trip ideas to help you create a custom itinerary and help you plan your next adventure.

**Trip Idea \#1: Kayak Fishing On Oregon’s Adventure Coast**

**![](/img/oregon-coast-fishing-trip-ideas-blog-695x322-jpg-2.jpg)**

Kayak fishing in Oregon is enjoying a surge in popularity. Beginners and families can find a friendly learning curve with a slow troll for trout or casting for bass on one of Oregon’s scenic lakes.

**Who’s it for:** Beginner and experienced Kayak anglers.

**Highlights:** Kayak fishing off [<u>Sunset Bay State Park</u>](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=70). *Others follow salmon runs or sturgeon migrations along Oregon’s rivers (and some might experience the unique kayak fishing “sleigh” ride — hooking a fish so big that it actually drags your boat around). Many adept kayak anglers head offshore into the ocean in search of cabezon, lingcod and the highly prized halibut.*

### Important to Know Before You Go&nbsp;

Unless it is a Free Fishing Weekend, a [<u>Fishing License</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing-license-requirements/) (or shellfish license for clamming & crabbing) is required for those aged 12 years or older. Daily licenses are available. Most fishing charters, bait shops and sporting goods stores can supply these for you, but ask your Charter in advance to make sure! You can purchase a shellfish or fishing license locally in stores like Bi-Mart, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Fred Myer, the ODFW Office (licenses only) in Charleston and Walmart.&nbsp; [<u>Click here</u>](https://myodfw.com/articles/how-buy-license-or-tag) to see the fishing license requirement and/or information about a shellfish license.
