Planning an adventure to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**? Bring your furry family members along! Oregon’s Adventure Coast is a travel destination that welcomes pets and offers numerous parks, beaches, and trails, along with various pet-friendly lodging, services, and restaurants - the "paw-sibilities" are endless! Dogs are not just welcomed—they're encouraged!

![](/img/dogs-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast.jpg)Being a responsible pet owner helps preserve the natural beauty of our region for everyone to enjoy. Here are some general “DO’S” and “DON’TS” of traveling with pets to Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

**<u>DO</u> ensure your pet is always on a leash and under control**. Many areas require this for the safety of both your pet and local wildlife. Leash laws vary by location, but generally, pets must be on a leash no longer than six feet in public areas.

**<u>DON’T</u> neglect to clean up after your pet!** Not only is picking up after your pet good manners, but pet waste causes pollution and disturbs local wildlife. It also poses potential health hazards and spoils the beauty and cleanliness of the environment for everyone.

**<u>DO</u> treat your well-behaved pup to a** [fun day on the beach.](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches) ** ** Many beaches along Oregon's Adventure Coast are pet-friendly, though pets are generally required to be on a leash, and the owner must clean up after them, as stated above. Two local favorites among pet owners are Horsfall Beach in North Bend and Bastendorff Beach in Charleston, both offering long stretches of sand perfect for running and playing. At these locations, well-behaved dogs are allowed off-leash as long as they remain under the owner's control at all times. For even more beach fun, visit [Seven Devils State Recreation Site Near Coos Bay](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=49), which features expansive sandy areas and charming coves to explore.

**<u>DON’T</u> take your pet(s) to Shore Acres State Park.** No animals, except for service animals, are allowed outside of vehicles in Shore Acres State Park and its formal gardens. Hikers with dogs already on the Oregon Coast Trail, which runs from Sunset Bay State Park to Cape Arago State Park through Shore Acres State Park, may continue along the trail. However, dogs must remain on the trail and in the parking lot area only. The trail does not extend to the area around the Observation Building, bathroom facilities, or the gardens.

**<u>DO</u> take your dog** [hiking & walking](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking)**.** Well-behaved dogs are welcome on most hiking trails, as long as they're leashed and you clean up after them. Be sure to keep your pet (and yourself) hydrated and provide ample breaks! Here are some pet-friendly hiking destinations we recommend:

* **Golden & Silver Falls State Natural Area:** Located about 30 miles from Highway 101 on Highway 241, this hidden gem in dense coastal forests boasts scenic canyons and lush forests leading to two stunning waterfalls. Enjoy views from various vantage points along the trail.

  &nbsp;

* **Cape Arago State Park:** Just a mile south of Shore Acres, Cape Arago State Park offers picnic areas and trails leading to a flat beach with expansive views of the coastline. Explore tidepools and spot seals and sea lions on Shell Island and Simpson Reef, part of the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge.

  &nbsp;

* **South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR):** Covering 19,000 acres off Cape Arago Highway on 7 Devils Road near Charleston, SSNERR features miles of well-maintained hiking trails suitable for all abilities. Keep an eye out for diverse marine life, plant species, and birds with your binoculars handy. Remember, dogs must be leashed at all times.

  &nbsp;

* **Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area:** This vast expanse of coastal sand dunes offers several trails your canine companion will love:
  * **Bluebill Trail:** Off Horsfall Road, this trail loops around a seasonal lake, offering bird-watching opportunities and serene meadow views.
  * **John Dellenback Dunes Trail:** Accessible via Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, this trail leads through open sand to the beach and includes an interpretive loop. This is the only non-motorized section of the Dunes and provides a safe hiking opportunity.
  * **Oregon Coast Trail (Sunset Bay to Cape Arago)**: Wind your way along 6.5 miles of breathtaking coastline, passing Shore Acres Botanical Gardens and Simpson Reef. Spectacular views await!

    &nbsp;

* **Shore Acres Loop Hike (Sunset Bay to Simpson Beach):** Considered one of Oregon's most beautiful hikes, this trail through coastal forests and sandstone cliffs promises unforgettable scenery and wildlife encounters.

**<u>DON’T</u> allow your pet to disturb wildlife or other visitors.** Maintaining control over your pet’s behavior ensures a pleasant experience for everyone on the coast.

**<u>DO</u> ensure your pet’s identification tags and microchip information are current.** It’s also a good idea to familiarize yourself with local veterinary services in the unlikely event you will need them. There are several veterinarians in Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston to choose from. If your furry loved one encounters an emergency during non-business hours, here are some options:

**DON’T Ignore Basic Safety Protocols to Keep Your Pet Safe.** Ensuring the safety of your four-legged friend during your visit is paramount. When visiting the beach, be aware of coastal hazards, such as undertows, sneaker waves, and rolling logs. Keep your pet hydrated, avoid hot sand and pavement, be mindful of wildlife, and never leave your pet unattended in a vehicle. Here are a few essential tips to remember:

* Respect the power of the ocean and never turn your back on it.
* Be cautious of sneaker waves, which can carry a dangerous undertow and appear unexpectedly. Exercise extra caution during the winter months.
* Note that there are no lifeguards on our beaches.
