The<a href="https://www.coosart.org/"> Coos Art Museum</a> has announced their upcoming exhibition of contemporary art, <em>All Things Salmon</em>, will open October 13th. The exhibition highlights the significance and influence salmon has had on society and culture throughout history.

The impact of this powerful migratory fish can be seen in art works from prehistoric stone carvings through contemporary glass. Nowhere is salmon art more evident than in the Pacific Northwest, where the salmon has been the source of life and sometimes controversy for hundreds of years. Juror, Dr. Deana Dartt former Curator of Native American Art at the Portland Art Museum and current Scholar-in-Residence at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, New Mexico has selected sixty stunning works of art to represent the range of salmon themed art today.

The <em>All Things Salmon</em> art competition is made possible by a generous grant from the Coquille Tribal Community Fund.
