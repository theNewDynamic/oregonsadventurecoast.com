### WHEN SHOULD I GO?

* The general rule of thumb if you wanna go crabbing is do it in a month with an ‘r’ (January, February, March, etc).
* Slack water (the time around high or low tide) are the best times to crab. During slack water, crabs are generally walking around and foraging since they are not getting pushed around by tidal exchange.

### WHAT SHOULD I BRING?

Make sure you have the following supplies before you head out along with the other items listed in the infographic.

* Shellfish license (Ages 12 and older require a shellfish license for crabbing)
* Crab measuring tool
* pots or rings (can be rented)
* Cooler
* Gloves
* Bait holders and bait supply

Rental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores. Here’s a short list of some locations:
