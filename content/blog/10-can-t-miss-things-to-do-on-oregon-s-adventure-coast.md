# 10 can’t-miss things to do in Coos Bay, Oregon

Below we share a roundup of 10 things to do in the Coos Bay area of Oregon! These activities are fun year-round, and make for the perfect trip to the southern Oregon coast.

### Book a coastal cabin or quirky themed stay

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-1.jpg)

Coos Bay has a wide variety of accommodations available, including great camping at [Sunset Bay State Park Campground](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;parkId=70) and [Bastendorff Beach Park](https://www.co.coos.or.us/parksrec/page/bastendorff). Outside of the parks, below we share two of the best places to stay in Coos Bay, Oregon.

#### Cute coastal cabins, Airstreams, and RV sites at Bay Point Landing

If you’re looking to relax I recommend staying at [Bay Point Landing](https://www.baypointlanding.com/). Located on the bay, they offer beautifully designed coastal cabins, Airstreams, and RV sites. The RV spaces and cabins are nicely spaced so that visitors aren’t on top of each other, and they have thoughtful amenities, including a laundry room, fitness room, heated saltwater pool, common spaces, and dog wash station. The property is pet-friendly.

#### Unique and FUN themed accommodations at Itty Bitty Inn

If you’re looking for unique and fun accommodations in town, [The Itty Bitty Inn](https://ittybittyinn.com/) is a must-book! This uniquely-themed hotel is a self-described “charming retro, non-fancy, geek chic motel located on Route 101.” The rooms all have unique themes, including an Oregon Trail room, Tiki Room, and a Star Trek room! We stayed in the Star Trek room and had a BLAST (you might say it was out of this world). The hotel does not allow smoking, pets, or shoes inside of the rooms.

### Try sandboarding at Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-2.jpg)

One of the most unique and fun activities to do around Coos Bay is sandboarding and sand sledding! Sandboarding is a lot like *snow*boarding, but you ride down sand instead of snow! This takes some practice, and good balance. If you want something a little more ‘tame’ I recommend a sand sled, which can be ridden while seated.

I recommend [renting sandboards from Bahama Boards](https://bahamaboardz.com/). As of summer 2025 their sandboards and sand sleds rented for $20 for the full day (10 am - 5 pm), or $25 for 24 hours. We used our sandboards at Hall Lake, which is located in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Site. This area does not allow ATVs or dune buggies, making it ideal for safe sandboarding. Park [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gURjHoDLJJjdtrYe9) and walk up the dunes behind the lake to get to the best sandboarding spots.

### Enjoy fresh fish and chips at Fishermen’s Seafood Market

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-3.jpg)

Located right on the waterfront, [Fishermen’s Seafood Market](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/eat-drink/restaurants/fishermens-seafood-market/) serves up the best fish and chips I’ve ever had. The rockfish is fresh, lightly battered, and fried to golden perfection. It’s crispy on the outside, flaky on the inside. I got the kid’s portion, which was generously sized. If you like fish and chips, this spot is a must-visit!

### Explore the tidepools at Cape Arago State Park

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-4.jpg)

[Cape Arago State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=66) is located on a scenic headland along the Oregon coast, and is one of THREE state parks in a single area. About 15 miles southwest of Coos Bay, this area is great for whale watching, beachcombing, and tide pooling. The best tidepools are located at [South Cove Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e7qK1Sz55ZPxChpGA).

When tidepooling, remember the mantra “if you pry, it will die.” If you choose to handle tide pool critters do NOT pry them from rocks – this can kill them. Only pick up critters that are unattached (like a hermit crab), and handle them gently and briefly. Many need water to breathe and survive, so they need to be returned to the water quickly! [Click here for more tips for responsible tidepooling](https://oregontidepools.org/index.php/what-to-do/etiquette)!

The tidepools are best viewed during negative low tides. Tide times differ every day. You can [access tide charts for the southern Oregon coast here](https://www.tideschart.com/United-States/Oregon/Coos-County/Coos-Bay/). Alternatively, [you can stop in at a visitor center](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/contact/) and pick up a free Tide Book.

### Fly a stunt kite on the beach or dunes

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45.jpg)

One of my favorite activities at the beach is flying stunt kites, and the southern Oregon coast is a GREAT place to do it! [Hall Lake](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hall+%26+Schuttpelz+Lakes+Day+Use+Area/@43.6045196,-124.1874189,17.82z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x54c395476664514d:0x23a20bc048e70078!2sHall+Lake!8m2!3d43.6003931!4d-124.1887257!16s%2Fg%2F1thvx_lj!3m5!1s0x54c39548ae56bee7:0x4d4193e6627b433f!8m2!3d43.6053657!4d-124.186554!16s%2Fg%2F11byx0hr7d?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkwNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and [Bastendorff Beach](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) are both great locations for kite flying. Generally, stunt kites require winds of 8 - 12 miles an hour or more to fly, so you’ll want to do this on a breezy day. We used the [Synapse 140 Foil Kite](https://rei.pxf.io/APVd11), which was super fun and easy to fly!

### Grab a handmade treat (and lots of samples!) at Cranberry Sweets Candy Factory

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-5.jpg)

The southern Oregon coast is famous for its cranberry production, and [Cranberry Sweets Candy Factory](https://cranberrysweets.com/) is a must-visit! They handmake and sell literally <u>dozens</u> of unique fruit candies and chocolate, including a variety of cranberry treats. Founded in the 1960s, visitors to the factory can see the sweets being made, and sample a variety of treats.

### Rent a kayak at the self-service station at John Topits Park

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-6.jpg)

John Topits Park is a 120 acre natural area preserving beautiful dunes, forest, and lakes. This a great place to canoe, SUP, and kayak, and [Coastal Kayak and SUP Rentals](https://coastalkayakandsuprentalsllc.com/) has a self-service kayak station there at the lake edge. At the station, you can rent up to 4 kayaks, along with PFDs (life jackets) and paddles. The self-service station is easy to use, and the lake is a great place for novices and expert kayakers alike!

### Enjoy forest bathing on the Oregon Coast

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-9.jpg)

One of the unique activities you can do on the southern Oregon coast is forest bathing. Also known as Shinrin-yoku, forest bathing involves immersing yourself in nature to support your physical and mental health. You can [learn more about forest bathing in Coos Bay here](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/forest-bathing/). You can do self-directed forest bathing or book a guided experience through [Mossy Lotus](https://mossylotus.com/).

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-16-1.jpg)

### Have a local beer at 7 Devils Brewery & Tap Room

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-10.jpg)

[7 Devils Brewery](https://7devilsbrewery.com/) is a must-visit in downtown Coos Bay, and we always stop for a pint or two when we’re in town! Their locally brewed beers celebrate the coast from ‘farm to foam.’ They have two locations: a brewery and pub, and a waterfront ale house. Both have different menus, so take note of the options before you decide which one to visit!

### Hike Golden and Silver Falls Trail to two majestic waterfalls

![](/img/10-can-t-miss-things-to-do-on-oregons-adventure-coast-gwyn-and-ami-blog-45-12.jpg)

Tucked away in the forest, [Golden and Silver Falls Trail](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=67) is a family-friendly hike that leads to two MAJESTIC waterfalls. The falls are best viewed in spring when the water is flowing, but they’re still beautiful in late summer (when flows are at their weakest). The falls are about 30 miles east of Coos Bay, and the drive can take up to an hour. This area is free to visit.
