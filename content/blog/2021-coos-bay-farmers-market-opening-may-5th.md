Spring is here and that means the annual[ CBDA Farmers Market](https://coosbaydowntown.org/farmers-market/), a popular open-air Farmers Market hosted by Coos Bay Downtown Association, is just around the corner! The Farmers Market happens weekly in the heart of downtown Coos Bay. The well-attended market is a joy for our community and visitors alike, and features fresh, locally grown produce, eggs, honey, meat, baked goods, soaps, candles, homemade jams, jellies, and unique creations handcrafted by local artisans.

Not only has the CBDA Farmers Market served as a wonderful destination to buy fresh local food, for many years it has served as a true community gathering place here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. Last year, the market made some adaptations under the guidance of local and state health officials, CDC Guidelines, and the Oregon Farmers Market Association (OFMA) and will continue to comply with all state and local guidelines to halt community spread of the coronavirus.

The CBDA Farmers Market will still feature traditional homegrown and local essential products but market-goers can expect to see changes at the market including physical distancing and other practices. Shoppers will be encouraged to be safe, shop quickly and purchase only essential items. They will also be asked to wear fabric face coverings and thoroughly wash hands before coming to the market. Hand washing stations will be available at the entrances to the market. All staff, volunteers, and vendors will be required to wear fabric face coverings and gloves, and vendors will have hand sanitizer at their booths. Other points to consider include the following:

* Bring personal hand sanitizer.
* Send one healthy member of your household with a shopping list
* Leave pets and younger children at home (Service Animals are allowed)
* Remember to clean & wash all purchased produce at home before eating.
