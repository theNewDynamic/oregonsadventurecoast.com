<h2>Training Tips</h2>

If you are new to running on Oregon's Adventure Coast, congratulations! You're about to embark on a very special journey. Follow these tips to help you get ready to face your next race head on!

<h3>#1 Find the Right Training Plan and Stick to It!</h3>

Failing to prepare is preparing to fail!  It takes time to get into running shape, so it's critical to follow a training plan that is right for you! Since most of the running events on Oregon's South Coast have multiple hills and trails, you will want to incorporate that into your training. A simple online search will bring you hundreds of viable training programs, though many new runners have found the <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51122/10K-Novice-Training-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hal Higdon Training Programs</a> to be easy to follow. You may want to consider finding a training partner to run with you. You're more likely to stick to your program if you are accountable to someone.  Depending on where you live, local running groups like our <a href="http://www.southcoastrunningclub.org/">South Coast Running Club</a> are a great place to find like-minded runners. Simply ask around to find a friend or neighbor who is up for the challenge.

<h3>#2 Book Your Accommodations Early</h3>

To run a good race, you must get a good night's sleep the night before and a place to rest and recover post-race. With just a couple of months to go until the <a href="http://prefontainerun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prefontaine Memorial Run</a> and <a href="https://www.charlestonsalmonrun.com/">Charleston Salmon Run</a>, we strongly advise that you visit our <a href="/lodging/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lodging Page</a> and book your accommodations asap!

<h3>#3 Invest in the Right Running Attire</h3>

The wrong socks, shoes and running attire will result in more blisters and chafing. Avoid wearing cotton since it has a tendency to trap in sweat. Look for breathable, moisture-wicking material and dress in layers. Oregon weather can change quickly! Do some research and invest in quality running shoes or else you risk injury due to improper footwear. If possible, head to a store for runners and ask the associate to help you find the right shoe and the right fit for you. If that's not an option, there are dozens of tips and guidelines you can find online.

<h3>#4 Learn The Route</h3>

If possible, preview the route where the run will take place. Familiarity will help you avoid any surprises come race time and allow your body to adjust to the course. If you can't train in person at the location, study it online to get a good feeling for what type of race it will be.
