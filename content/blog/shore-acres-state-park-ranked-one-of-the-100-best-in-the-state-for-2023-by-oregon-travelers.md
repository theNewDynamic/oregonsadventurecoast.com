_Known as "the jewel of the South Coast", the ever-popular Shore Acres State Park ranks #23 on the Oregon Business 100 Best “Fan-Favorite'' Destinations in Oregon for 2023!_

**Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** is known for its remarkable selection of [natural attractions and state parks](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/), but there is one destination that seems to always stand out from the rest: [Shore Acres State Park](https://shoreacres.net/). Perched high above the Pacific on rugged sandstone cliffs, Shore Acres is often referred to as "the jewel of the South Coast". The well-kept grounds, hiking trails and gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean are nothing short of grand, and the glorious gardens of Shore Acres State Park inspire visitors and locals alike.

Oregon Business magazine has brought back its popular list of [100 Best “Fan-Favorite'' Destinations in Oregon](https://www.oregonbusiness.com/100best/destinations), and we are delighted to announce that Shore Acres State Park is ranked #23 on this year's list! Out of roughly 9,000 destinations in Oregon, Shore Acres State Park was chosen by travelers as one of their favorite travel destinations in the state.

According to Oregon Business magazine, tens of thousands of online reviews from Google, Yelp and Tripadvisor were painstakingly analyzed to determine the best destinations in Oregon based on customer satisfaction. In late-March, the magazine will publish the official 2023 **100 Best “Fan-Favorite” Destinations** in Oregon map, which will be distributed throughout Oregon at points-of-entry and visitor/information centers.

**There’s a reason Shore Acres State Park is known as the “Jewel of the South Coast”.** What began as a luxurious private estate belonging to lumber and shipping tycoon, Louis Simpson, has become a beloved local treasure filled with history and beauty for all to enjoy. The park has received accolades from media outlets and travel organizations throughout the United States. The park is best known for its famous Holiday Lights on display November-December of every year, but visitors also come here to explore its gardens while taking in spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean. Winter storms often bring towering waves crashing against the shoreline and cliffs, while whale watchers have ample opportunities to spot migrating whales during the winter and summer migrating seasons. A secluded ocean cove at Simpson Beach awaits those willing to hike down the somewhat steep trail.
