An eager crowd joined tribal members of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians, along with local business leaders last week to witness the ribbon cutting ceremony and grand opening of the new <a href="http://threeriverscasino.com/" target="_blank">Three Rivers Casino Coos Bay</a>. After months of construction, the casino features a 15,000 square foot casino floor with 250 new bingo-slots along with a full service restaurant and bar, <a href="http://threeriverscasino.com/page/coos-bay/cafe-1297" target="_blank">Cafe 1297</a>.

The class II gaming facility, located at 1297 Ocean Blvd. in the Empire area, is owned and operated by the The Confederated Tribe of Coos, Siuslaw Indians, and Lower Umpqua.

Former tribal council chair Bob Garcia says he envisioned the business as just the beginning of better things to come in the Empire area. “What I see this as is the first step in the revitalization of Empire,” he recently told <a href="http://theworldlink.com/news/local/business/three-rivers-casino-coos-bay-to-open-may/article_41513331-ce0f-5463-a583-7635f80b0118.html" target="_blank">The World Newspaper</a>. “We want to make investments in the area and see things improve.”

“Our investment in this facility reflects the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians’ long-term commitment to the local southern Oregon coast community,” said Garcia in an announcement of the opening event. “We believe in this community and we want to build and maintain a positive partnership with everyone here.”
