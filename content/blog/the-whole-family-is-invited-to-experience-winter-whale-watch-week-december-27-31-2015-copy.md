### **Come Have a "Whale of a Time" During Winter 2018 Whale Watching Week December 27th – 31st, 2018**

Planning to take some time off for the holidays? Cap off the year with a Whale Watching Trip on the Oregon Coast. Not only will you create priceless memories, it's a wonderful learning experience for the whole family.

Thanks to the [Whale Watching Spoken Here® ](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=thingstodo.dsp_whalewatching)program, Oregon Coast visitors can learn important lessons about the Gray whales and their annual migration south from knowledgeable and helpful trained volunteers for no charge during **Winter Whale Watch Week: Thursday, December 27th – Monday, December 31st, 2018.**

An estimated 18,000 Gray whales will migrate annually from the Arctic Ocean to the warm Baja lagoons of Mexico. Most of the whales will be about 5 miles out, but some can be seen as close as 1-2 miles off shore.

Plan to stop at one of the [designated Whale Watching Spoken Here® sites](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&t=m&msa=0&z=7&source=embed&ie=UTF8&mid=zweC21xpv7NQ.krK2xC0y40W4)  between **10 a.m. to 1 p.m.** during the 2018 Winter Whale Watch Week you just may witness the beautiful sight of Gray whales blowing, breaching and fluking as they pass by on their 12,000-mile journey from the Arctic Ocean.

To get a head start,  here are some interesting facts about gray whales…

* Gray Whales are noted for their 12,000-mile annual migration from the Arctic Ocean to Mexico in the winter and their return north in the spring.
* Whalers nicknamed the Grays “Devil Fish” because they fought so hard to defend their babies.
* Today, they are best known for being friendly to people.
* In the 1600-1700s Gray Whales in the Atlantic were hunted to extinction.
* They were hunted almost to extinction two different times in the Pacific Ocean.
* Starting early in the 1900s, the birthing lagoons were protected by the Mexican government.
* The United Nations joined in the protection (1935), as did the International Whaling Commission (1946), but the moratorium against whaling wasn’t started until 1986.
* The Grays made a good recovery and were taken off the endangered list in 1994, but are still threatened.
* The reason for the migration south is to give birth to their young in the warm, calm bays of Mexico.
* Gray Whale babies are 15 feet long and weigh 2,000 at birth
* The grow up to 45 feet long and weigh 70,000 pounds.
* They return north and spend the summer feeding in the Bering and Chukchi Seas (they seldom eat during migration).
* About 200 Gray Whales don’t continue to Alaska, but stay along the Oregon Coast to feed.
* Grays have baleen plates instead of teeth, with 130-180 plates or pieces along each side of the upper jaw.
* They take great mouthfuls of food-laden water; then using their tongues, they squeeze out the water and swallow the food that sticks to the baleen.
* The Oregon coast produces lots of phytoplankton (small marine plants) which are eaten by zooplankton (small marine animals) including bottom dwelling amphipods and mysid shrimp – primary food of the Gray Whales.
* The only natural predators of Gray Whales are Orcas (killer whales) and large sharks. Even though some countries are still whaling, the biggest threat to the whales is pollution in the oceans.

**Whale Watching Spoken Here®** is currently the largest whale watching organization in the world. For more than 30 years hundreds of trained volunteers have helped visitors watch whales at 26 sites in three states along the Pacific Northwest coast.

The Whale Watching Spoken Here program also accepts new volunteers each year to be placed at great whale watching sites during Watch Weeks so they can teach others while watching the whales too. If you love whales, consider volunteering for this outstanding organization!
