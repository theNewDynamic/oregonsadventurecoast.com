### Planning to Travel to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston** in 2023? Start Planning Your Time Off TODAY!

It’s a new year, which means it’s time to start planning your next big adventure. Multiple studies have shown that taking time off from work has many positive benefits for one’s mental health and productivity. Yet, many of us STILL neglect to take all our vacation days! The[ U.S. Travel Association](https://www.ustravel.org/) says Americans are more likely to use all their paid time off when they plan their vacation days at the beginning of the year. To encourage us to take time off and recharge, they have designated January 31, 2023 [National Plan for Vacation Day](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/want-to-be-happier-in-2021-plan-a-vacation/?utm_source=adventure-january-2022&utm_medium=mailchimp&utm_campaign=cbnb-newsletter+)!

So, if you want to be happier with your job, health and wellbeing in 2023, make a plan to use all your time off this year. Here are some tips to help you plan your vacation to Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston.

### Step One: Figure Out WHEN You Want to Come

Because of our temperate marine climate, Oregon’s Adventure Coast is an all-season destination. There is a magnificent adventure waiting for you here any time of the year. Summer and fall are our most popular months for visitors, but there are advantages to visiting other times of the year, as we point out in our recent post, [Reasons to Visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast in the Off-Season](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/reasons-to-visit-oregon-s-adventure-coast-in-the-off-season/).

To determine the best time for you to visit, we recommend researching annual events that are happening, along with various adventures and experiences you’d like to have. For example, if Winter Storm Watching and/or Whale Watching appeals most to you, we recommend planning your trip during the months of November, December and January. Or, if you’ve always wanted to try stand-up paddle boarding or salmon fishing, you may want to consider taking your trip during the warmer months of June-September.

**Research Upcoming Events**

The best time of year to visit could depend on specific [events on Oregon’s Adventure Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/events/). For example, we often get an influx of travelers during the holidays here for the Holiday Lights at Shore Acres Park.
