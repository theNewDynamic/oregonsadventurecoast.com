Have your hiking boots been neglected this year? Are they calling out to you and begging you to take them somewhere, anywhere, other than your dark, dusty closet? Have you forgotten what breathing fresh air feels like? If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions - it’s time to grab those hiking boots and come to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston.** Our region is a hiker’s paradise, and there is no time like summer to get outdoors and take on a rejuvenating hike!

If you worry you’re just too out-of-shape or out-of-practice, fear not! No matter your skill level, there is a [hiking trail for you](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking/). Some of the most stunning and diverse landscapes in the country are right in our backyard! Whether it’s climbing majestic sand dunes, hiking through a rugged coastal forest or overlooking the Pacific, a beautiful adventure awaits. Here are some tips to help you plan the best hiking trip on Oregon’s Adventure Coast:

**# 1 PACK SMART**

The [weather on Oregon’s Adventure Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/travelers-info/) is temperate year round, but there are seasonal fluctuations and daily ranges. We strongly recommend dressing in layers to adjust temperature accordingly. A light, waterproof jacket and sweaters come in handy even in the summertime, and depending on the season, a combination of shorts and long pants will give you some options for daytime adventures. Obviously, you’ll want to bring your walking/hiking boots along with several changes of socks.

_PRO TIP: Pack a pair of binoculars so you can view breathtaking vistas of the Pacific Ocean, along with the playful sea lions, harbor seals, and occasional elephant seals from the viewing areas on Oregon’s Adventure Coast!_

**#2 STAY HYDRATED**

There are miles and miles of trails on Oregon’s Adventure Coast you don’t want to miss, so you’ll need to stay hydrated to keep up your energy level. Be sure to bring a reusable water bottle and keep it handy. Speaking of staying hydrated, many local hiking trails and state parks allow dogs as long as they are on leashes (be sure to check the park’s pet policy before you go). Make sure you bring plenty of water for your furry friend (rule of thumb is 1 quart of water for your dog for every three miles you plan to hike).

**#3- MAKE A PLAN AND BE SAFE**

Visitors are encouraged to stay safe by following these simple rules: Prepare. Care. Connect. Hiking conditions are subject to weather patterns, seasonal closures and other elements outside our control. Therefore, make sure to make a plan and check the appropriate websites before heading out. We encourage you to hike with others and/or notify someone where you are going and when you expect to be back. Always carry a cell phone, but be prepared in case you have a poor signal. Travel Oregon recently launched a campaign, [Take Care Out There](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/take-care-out-there/), to help promote responsible recreation in Oregon and ensure outdoor opportunities for health, connection and joy for generations to come.

**#4 KNOW THE TIDES & NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO THE OCEAN**

Our quiet, peaceful, [undeveloped beaches](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) are ideal for hiking, but we urge you to learn & follow [critical safety guidelines](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.com/blog/eight-ways-to-stay-safe-on-the-beaches-along-the-oregon-coast/) while you’re near the ocean. What should be a beautiful day by the Pacific Ocean could suddenly become unsafe without warning if you are not careful.

Check the tide times at [tides-forecast.com](https://www.tide-forecast.com/regions/Oregon). Read [Safe Ways to Explore the Beach](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=v.page&id=96) for more information.

**#5 FUEL UP BEFORE & AFTER YOUR DAY OF HIKING**

Don’t go out on the trails on an empty stomach! There are many locally owned restaurants dishing out hearty breakfasts, satisfying lunches/dinners, and the freshest seafood you could hope for. [Download our Local Restaurant Guide](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/Restaurants-BOOKLET-FINAL-041221.pdf) to keep with you, or visit [Oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/) to see all our local restaurants.

**#6 LEAVE NO TRACE**

Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston is full of treasured natural destinations to enjoy, and it is up to us to be good stewards of the land. All visitors are responsible for their own actions, and we ask them to take special care and [follow Leave No Trace principles](https://lnt.org/learn/seven-principles-overview). **Please do not touch the wildlife under any circumstances!** If you see wildlife, please appreciate it from afar and do not attempt to touch or interact with them - it is, after all, their home.

**#7 BOOK EARLY & STAY AWHILE**

There are no shortage of comfortable lodging options on [Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston ](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/)that will suit your needs and preferences. However, summer tends to be our busier season, and there’s much pent-up travel energy coming our way! We recommend booking your accommodations as early as possible.
