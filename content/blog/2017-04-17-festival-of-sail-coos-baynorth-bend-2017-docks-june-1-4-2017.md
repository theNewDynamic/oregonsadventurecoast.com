It’s happening! It&#8217;s really happening! Later this spring, Coos Bay and North Bend will be one of only a handful of Pacific ports that will host historic ships during the annual [Festival of Sail®](http://festofsailcoosbay.com/), June 1st-4th, 2017. This annual festival draws enthusiastic crowds from all over the region as it&#8217;s &#8220;a rare chance to catch a glimpse, step aboard, and even set sail on some of the grandest ships of yore&#8221;.

[Festival of Sail® Coos Bay / North Bend 2017](http://festofsailcoosbay.com/) will be the first of its kind for our area. Eight awe-inspiring historic ships including _Bill of Rights, Schooner Freda B, Lady Washington, Hawaiian Chieftain_ and _Dirigo II_ will gallantly sail into port at The Mill Casino in North Bend, Oregon for a four day celebration.

In addition to viewing the largest fleet of historic ships we have seen in our region, visitors will enjoy activities the whole family will enjoy including ship tours, day sails, educational programming, food and beverage, entertainment and fun! Ticket prices range from $9-$150.
