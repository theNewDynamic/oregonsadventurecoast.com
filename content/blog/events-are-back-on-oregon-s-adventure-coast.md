Ready for good news? We are. As COVID-19 cases decline and vaccination rates increase, the County Risk Level of Coos County, home of **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston**, has been moved to the [“Lower Risk” Tier](https://nbc16.com/news/coos-county-oregon/as-coos-county-moves-to-low-risk-businesses-customers-sense-return-of-normalcy-06-09-2021)! That means things are going to start looking and feeling a lot more normal around here! It also means many of the beloved annual events that make our region such a special place, including the [Bay Area Fun Festival](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-bay-area-fun-festival-2019/) and [Holiday Lights at Shore Acres](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-holiday-lights-at-shore-acres/), will be BACK!

While we can’t wait to welcome our back our visitors, we humbly ask you to keep the following in mind:

### **Please be patient and courteous to our frontline workers as we transition back to “normal”.**

Local businesses are doing their best to adjust and reopen at a higher capacity with limited staff and resources. Many workers in the hospitality and retail industries have been tasked with doing their regular jobs while taking on additional duties for staff members who have been furloughed or let go. On top of this, these workers have been tasked with enforcing state-mandated face-covering requirements, social distancing standards and other protocols. **The bottom line: we’re all in this together. Please show our local businesses and their staff kindness and patience while they work to restore their normal operations.**

### **Pack your masks and/or face coverings, even if you’re fully vaccinated.**

Please be respectful if you’re asked to wear a face covering. Face coverings are required outdoors when social distancing is impossible to maintain. Oregon also now requires visitors to wear a face covering indoors regardless of vaccination status. According to [Travel Oregon’s latest guidelines](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/what-to-expect-at-oregon-destinations-during-covid-19/), “Some businesses and attractions are instead allowing fully vaccinated visitors to forgo a face covering, though they may require verification of vaccination status.” ( Note this is not a HIPAA violation.) Bring proof of your vaccination status and always carry a face covering with you, especially if you’d rather not show your vaccine card.”

### **Local restaurants and shops are open and ready for your business!**

Many [restaurants in Coos Bay/North Bend and Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/) offer both outside and inside table service. If you are not comfortable with in-person dining, many still offer delivery, pick-up and curbside service. Most [local retail stores and boutiques](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/shopping/) are open, with some protocols still in effect. Please check with the shop or shops you wish to visit for their specific protocols. Please keep in mind that some businesses may have additional requirements of customers, including face masks. **Be sure to contact the restaurant you wish to visit in advance to confirm hours, availability and new rules.**

### **Stay Healthy!**

If you are ready to travel, we are ready to welcome you back to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**. However, if you are feeling ill or not comfortable traveling right now, we encourage you to stay home and stay healthy. Here are some suggestions to help you stay healthy.

* Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
* Cover nose and mouth using bent elbow or a tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
* Practice social distancing of 6 feet when in small crowds.
