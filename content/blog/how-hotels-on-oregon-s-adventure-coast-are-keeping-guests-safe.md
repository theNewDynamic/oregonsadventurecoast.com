**What Travelers Can Expect As We Reopen Oregon’s Adventure Coast**  
There’s an old saying that goes “Expect the Unexpected”. Who would have expected just a few months ago that we’d all find ourselves navigating a world facing a pandemic? The COVID-19 crisis has impacted travel all over the world, and Oregon’s Adventure Coast is no exception. Earlier this month, [we entered into Phase Two of the reopening process](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/ready.set.adventure-what-travelers-can-expect-as-we-reopen-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) which means that we are ready to welcome our visitors back this summer, but travelers staying in hotels will notice a few changes. Here are some FAQ’s we’ve received about traveling to Oregon’s Adventure Coast this summer.

**Will my family and I be safe staying in a hotel?** Local hotels are going above and beyond to ensure the safety of their guests. While each hotel has adopted their own individual responses to COVID-19, all businesses entering into Phase Two must follow specific guidelines set by local health authorities.

**What’s going to be different?** Here are some of the changes you may notice when staying in a local hotel.

* Check-in procedures will require minimal contact with hotel staff. Some hotels will offer remote check-in, plexiglass dividers at the front desk.
* Upgraded sanitation and deep cleaning procedures of guest rooms and common areas.
* Hotel staff will conduct more frequent disinfecting throughout the day of high touch areas like elevator buttons.
* Social distancing measures throughout the hotel like floor markers to indicate where guests should stand for their safety.
* Hand sanitizer and/or disinfectant wipes for guests to use when they are in common areas.
* Hotel staff will be required to wear masks for your safety and guests will be encouraged to also wear face coverings while in public.

**What About Breakfast?** The hotel breakfast experience that some travelers have become accustomed to are also likely to be modified in some way to comply with guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Restaurant Association. Like local restaurants, breakfast rooms will have more space between tables, hand sanitizing stations, and more stringent disinfecting practices will be put into place to keep guests safe. Hotels may offer more “grab & go” breakfast options or provide limited table service for breakfast items.

**What about hotel amenities like pools and workout rooms?** Hotels that choose to open on-site pools and gyms to their guests will likely limit the number of people using it to half capacity and reservations may be required. Contact your hotel to find out more details about safety measures they have adopted to stop the spread of COVID-19. 

Here are some links to COVID-19 responses and guidelines from some of our local hotels. _Please contact your individual hotel for more details._

We look forward to welcoming you back to Oregon’s Adventure Coast. We cannot say for sure how long it will be before things “return to normal” but we will do everything we can in the meantime to keep our travelers safe and informed on the latest developments. In the meantime, wear a mask, wash your hands and practice social distancing so we can keep moving in the right direction and stay open for business this summer and beyond.
