Is the best holiday lights display on the West Coast right here on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston**? Many would say yes. The [Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-holiday-lights-at-shore-acres/), running November 27–December 31, 2025, stands out not only for its whimsical, creative displays set in a historic garden overlooking the Pacific, but also for being one of the most affordable and community-driven holiday experiences in Oregon.

![A vibrant nighttime scene at Shore Acres shows trees, shrubs, and garden displays wrapped in colorful holiday lights reflecting across the pond, one of the signature views of the Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.](/img/holiday-lights-at-shore-acres-pond.jpg "A vibrant nighttime scene at Shore Acres shows trees, shrubs, and garden displays wrapped in colorful holiday lights reflecting across the pond, one of the signature views of the Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.")

![A whimsical holiday display inside The Garden House at Shore Acres features a Santa mannequin relaxing in a glowing bubble-filled bathtub beside another Santa figure surrounded by teddy bears, festive garlands, and a small decorated Christmas tree—one of the many creative scenes showcased during the Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres.](/img/holiday-lights-at-shore-acres-state-park.jpg "A whimsical holiday display inside The Garden House at Shore Acres - one of the many creative scenes showcased during the Annual Holiday Lights at Shore Acres.")

It’s a long-standing community tradition that feels genuinely one-of-a-kind. Admission to the light display is free, and the only cost is a timed-entry parking permit ($10 per vehicle), which is a great value compared to other holiday light shows in Oregon, where prices can reach up to $38 to $49 per car. It’s completely free if you use the complimentary shuttle service that runs from the Charleston Marina parking lot every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve, as well as on Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Eve! The Charleston Fishing Families also welcome guests with complimentary hot cocoa, coffee, and cider, along with activities for the kids, adding to the festive spirit.

![A bus drops off visitors near the illuminated entrance pavilion at Shore Acres State Park during the Annual Holiday Lights event, where complimentary shuttles from the Charleston Marina help guests arrive for the festive displays, warm drinks, and family activities.](/img/free-shuttle-at-shore-acres-state-park-holiday-lights.jpg "A bus drops off visitors near the illuminated entrance pavilion at Shore Acres State Park during the Annual Holiday Lights event, where complimentary shuttles from the Charleston Marina help guests arrive for the festive displays, warm drinks, and family activities.")

We’ve gathered all the details about when to visit, how to reserve your timed parking pass, and where and when to catch the free shuttle on our [Holiday Lights at Shore Acres State Park event page](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-holiday-lights-at-shore-acres/). This event is very popular, so make sure you plan in advance!
