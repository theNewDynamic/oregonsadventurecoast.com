With such of range of prime fishing spots, it&#8217;s no wonder Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area is an angler&#8217;s dream come true! Between the bay, ocean and 30+ lakes and rivers, you&#8217;re all but guaranteed to enjoy a fishing trip worth bragging about this spring and summer. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to help you plan the ultimate fishing adventure this spring!

### Step One: Decide what kind of fishing adventure you’re looking for.

So you prefer [saltwater fishing](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay/) or [freshwater fishing](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/fresh-water-fishing-options-by-body-of-water/) (we have plenty of both). [Crabbing & Clamming](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/featured-adventures/fishing-crabbing-clamming/)? <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/2017/02/where-can-i-find-the-best-kayak-fishing-on-oregons-adventure-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kayak fishing</a>? Deciding on the type of fish you want to catch will play a huge factor in where you are going to fish. For instance, if it’s Chinook Salmon you’re after this spring, you will want to embark on a [deep sea fishing](/2016/05/deep-sea-fishing-on-oregons-south-coast-with-betty-kay-charters/) excursion in the Pacific.

If you’re looking for trout, you’re best bet will be to stick to the lakes (which have recently been stocked with trout).

Is it Surfperch you want? You’ll want to hit one of our beaches like Bastendorff Beach, Horsfall Beach and Cape Arago State Park.

Want to go digging for clams? Clamming is excellent during low tides near Charleston, off Cape Arago Highway, and Clam Island. There are also good places to dig clams even on positive low tides in Coos Bay.

As you can see, there are numerous options to choose from!

### Step two: Once you have an idea on what you want to catch, do some quick research!

We strongly recommend checking current fishing conditions by going to <a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/RR/southwest/#fishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife&#8217;s website</a>. Visitors will also find excellent tips and recommendations by calling local businesses like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/basintacklecharleston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basin Tackle Shop</a> and <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bites-on-bait-and-tackle-coos-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bite&#8217;s On Bait & Tackle</a>. Their employees are known to be a friendly and helpful resource for anyone that needs fishing, clamming, or crabbing tips and gear and current information.

### Step Four: Get an Oregon fishing license!

You can purchase a fishing license locally in stores like Bi-Mart, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Fred Myer, the ODFW Office (licenses only) in Charleston and Walmart.  [Click here](/travelers-guide/fishing-license-requirements/) to see the fishing license requirement.

### Step Four: Make arrangements.

There are a number of resources to help you with your accommodations. [Camping options](http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=70) as well as <a href="http://www.rvparkreviews.com/regions/oregon/coos-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RV parks</a> and [hotels](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/) to choose from.

### Step Five: Pack accordingly.

The weather changes often so pack accordingly. Layers are key! No matter what season, be sure to pack a jacket, long pants and sweaters. Other essentials include: windbreaker, sunscreen, lip balm, wide-brimmed hat, Polarized sunglasses, waterproof jacket and rain pants, bug spray, small first aid kit, hand sanitizer and/or wipes, backpack, collapsible cooler, reusable drinking bottle, waterproof bag&#8230;gosh, we could devote an entire blog post to this subject alone!
