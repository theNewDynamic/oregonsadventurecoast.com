If you’re planning to visit **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** anytime soon, we 100% recommend a ride along the [<u>Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/oregon-dunes-national-recreation-area/). We frequently hear from visitors who are interested in renting an [<u>ATV</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/atv-motorsports/) and exploring the Oregon Dunes, but first-time riders often do not feel comfortable embarking on this level of adventure alone. After all, it wouldn’t be difficult for an inexperienced rider to get lost or disoriented in the largest expanse of coastal dunes in North America, with more than 32,186 acres of dunes, forest, streams and lakes!&nbsp; Fortunately, there’s the perfect solution: [<u>Spinreel Dune Buggy &amp; ATV Rental's'Follow Me Tour'</u>](https://www.ridetheoregondunes.com/follow-me-tour/).&nbsp;

Spinreel Dune Buggy & ATV Rental, a local family-owned and operated business, is located just a few miles north of North Bend and Coos Bay, near one of the largest riding areas in the Oregon Dunes. The staff is incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and committed to offering riders the quintessential Oregon Dunes riding experience while keeping them safe. Their vehicles are well maintained and follow a strict regimen of safety protocols.&nbsp;

One of their flagship offerings is a [<u>We Guide, You Drive</u>](https://www.ridetheoregondunes.com/follow-me-tour/) tour that lasts anywhere between 1 3⁄4 to 2 1⁄4 hours. An experienced guide leads new ATV drivers on an unforgettable journey up and down coastal dunes, forests, and along Horsfall Beach, with stops along the way to take in the unsurpassed views of the Pacific Ocean and the Bay.

It’s the perfect way to enjoy a complete dune and beach riding experience without the worry of your vehicle breaking down, getting lost, or worse - getting hurt in an accident. The guides are there to keep everyone safe and help protect the dunes as you experience the thrill of careening over 500 foot high dunes and the beauty of the beach along the Pacific ocean.&nbsp;

Here’s a tip! If you’re lucky enough to be accompanied by Rango, the adorable “guide-pup” and his owner, be sure to get a photo with him!&nbsp;

Here are some other tips you should probably know:

**\#1- Do not show up without a reservation.** Before you head to **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston and Spinreel ATV**, you will need to reserve your place on the guided tour and pay in advance. The 'Follow Me Tour' is one of Spinreel’s most popular offerings and space is limited, especially in the summer when it’s peak travel season.&nbsp;

**\#2- Know the requirements to drive or ride in one of their vehicles.** All drivers of any Polaris vehicle must be at least 18 years of age **<u>and have a valid driver's license.</u>** Children who are approximately 52 inches or taller and wear a helmet are allowed to be passengers in most vehicles, but the driver of a vehicle with children as passengers must be at least 25 years old. We strongly recommend contacting the business prior to making your reservation to confirm eligibility for everyone in your party.&nbsp;

**\#3- Arrive early and bring a credit card!** You will need to give yourself enough time to check-in, fill out paperwork, sign a waiver, and pay a deposit on your vehicle (ranging from $500-$1500 authorization depending on the vehicle) that will be released once the vehicle is returned undamaged. Here is Spinreel’s policy according to their website, *“the credit card authorization will be released by Spinreel at the end of your rental time, pending no damage. It depends on your card company when that money is released back onto the card. VISA Cards can release the money back to you usually 1 to 10 days. Debit Cards and Mastercards can take up to 30 days. Please check with your card company to see what their policy is.”*

**\#4- Dress appropriately.** Be mindful that the weather changes in Oregon, ALOT! We recommend wearing layered clothing that allows you to adjust temperature accordingly. **<u>Closed toed shoes are required (no sandals/flip flops).</u>** Spinreel provides helmets and goggles that must be worn by everyone operating or riding in or on any vehicle. We recommend bringing sunscreen and applying generously to exposed skin every few hours. Even on overcast days, you can get a sunburn!

**\#5- Follow their safety protocols.** Before heading out on your adventure, all vehicle operators must watch a safety video, review the riding area map, and participate in a vehicle orientation to ensure that all drivers and riders are comfortable with the vehicle operation.

**\#6- Try not to get stuck while riding, but don’t panic if you do!** It happens, but if you paid attention to the safety video, you should walk away knowing what to do if your vehicle does get stuck, and tips on how to prevent getting stuck in the first place. If you’re on a guided tour, a Spinreel staff member will be there to help.&nbsp;

**\#7 - Leave no trace.** The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, a rare combination of forest, ocean and desert, is one of our most unique treasured natural destinations on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. It is up to us to be good stewards of the land. If you see wildlife, please appreciate it from afar and do not attempt to touch or interact with them - it is after all, their home. All visitors are responsible for their own actions, and we ask them to take special care and [<u>follow Leave No Trace principles</u>](https://lnt.org/learn/seven-principles-overview).&nbsp;
