Watch the seal and sea lions on[ Simpson Reef and Shell Island](https://www.shareoregon.com/things-to-do/en/listings/126105-simpson-reef-and-shell-island-oregon-islands-nwr), part of the[ Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/oregon_islands/).

**#7 Crabbing, Clamming and/or Fishing.**

Speaking of appetites, dining on fresh seafood you caught yourself from the bay is an experience every Oregon Coast visitor should have. Winter is a wonderful time to go crabbing on the Southern Oregon Coast, whether you like to catch them yourself or simply eat them. Any crabber will tell you the general rule of thumb if you wanna go crabbing is to do it in a month with an ‘r’ (January, February, March, etc).[ Click here](https://myodfw.com/articles/how-crab) to read some important crabbing tips from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. You can also go [clamming](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/clamming/) or[ fishing](https://oregonsadventurecoast.netlify.com/fishing/) in the bay or one of the 30+ local lakes and rivers in the area.

**#9 Unplug & Reconnect With Nature at the South Slough NERR.**

There is plenty of space to spread out and safely explore miles of beautiful hiking trails and waterways. Spend a day hiking, kayaking, or birdwatching at the[ South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/ten-things-people-love-about-slough-national-estuarine-research-reserve/).

**#10- Last, But Not Least: Go Whale Watching!**

Pack those binoculars because you’re in for a “fin-tastic” time this winter! Visitors will have an amazing opportunity to view some of the thousands of Gray whales migrating south in the Pacific Ocean each winter.

Due to COVID, the [Whale Watching Spoken Here®](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=thingstodo.dsp_whalewatching) program will not be happening this year, but visitors can still watch these mysterious and awe-inspiring creatures as they pass the Oregon Coast on their annual 12,000-mile journey south.
