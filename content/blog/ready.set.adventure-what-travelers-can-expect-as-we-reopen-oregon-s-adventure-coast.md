So much has changed in our world since the COVID-19 crisis began a few months ago, but we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Although it will take time to “get back to normal”, steps are being made in the right direction. On June 6th, 2020 Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston a.k.a. Oregon’s Adventure Coast was allowed to enter into Phase 2 of the reopening process. This means that our community has spent at least 21 days in Phase 1 and saw no significant increase in COVID-19 cases. If you’re planning on traveling this summer and fall, you’re probably wondering what’s open and what’s safe.

As Oregon’s Adventure Coast begins to carefully reopen, it’s important that visitors make informed decisions and prepare themselves for our “now normal” (because this won’t be forever!). Here are some answers to questions you may have to help you decide if you and your family are ready for an Oregon Coast Adventure!

**What Does Phase Two Mean for Travelers to Oregon’s Adventure Coast?** It means that we are ready to welcome our visitors back this summer, but things may look a little different. Don’t worry, our region is still as beautiful as ever and offers travelers space to spread out, socially distance themselves while relaxing and recharging.

**What’s Open?** The Visitors Information Centers in Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston re-opened last week under some strict protocols to keep volunteers, patrons and staff safe. Our volunteers are on hand to help you find things to see and do while you are here.

**What's New?** The Governor of Oregon issued an order, effective July 1, 2020, requiring  face coverings be worn in all indoor public spaces.

**Retail Stores, Boutiques, Antique Stores and Galleries.** Many of our [local retail stores and boutiques](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/shopping/) have re-opened, but with stringent cleaning and social distancing protocols in effect. Most are offering shoppers hand sanitizer to use when they enter and ask that face masks be worn to help protect employees and customers from the virus. Please check with the shop or shops you wish to visit for their specific protocols.

**Restaurants and Bars.** Many [restaurants in Coos Bay/North Bend and Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/) are still offering delivery, pick-up and curbside service. But some have opened their dining areas at reduced capacity by changing the layout to maintain physical distancing requirements and have implemented enhanced food safety and sanitation procedures. Self-service operations and pre-set tableware are prohibited under Phase Two guidelines. Please keep in mind that some businesses may have additional requirements of customers, such as face masks. Please be sure to contact the restaurant you wish to visit in advance to confirm hours and new rules.

**Parks and Public Lands.** Parks and public lands began to reopen as of May 29, 2020 for day use only and have since begun slowly opening overnight camping facilities. Please bear in mind that guidelines and open status are subject to change without notice and depend on which agency manages it. Here’s a quick run-down of what outdoor destinations are open (remember, this list is subject to change). Be sure to research current guidelines before making the trip! Check the [Oregon State Parks Status Map](https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=v.dsp_parkstatus) for the most up-to-date list.
