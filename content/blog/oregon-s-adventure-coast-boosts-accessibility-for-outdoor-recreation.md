We believe everyone who visits **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** should be able to enjoy its natural beauty and welcoming communities. To make our region a more inclusive destination, the [Oregon Coast Visitors Association (OCVA)](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/) and coastal partners like us are engaged in various initiatives to enhance Travelability, ensuring everyone can enjoy the Oregon coast. In addition, the Coos Bay Visitor Center recently added a solution for visitors with mobility challenges, so they can also enjoy the natural amenities that make Oregon’s South Coast such a special place to visit.

## Visitors with Limited Mobility Can Now Access Beaches & Trails With David’s Chair

We are thrilled to announce the addition of David's Chair Outdoor Mobility Systems, an all-terrain track chair, enabling individuals with mobility challenges to access difficult terrains like beaches and trails. David’s Chair is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering mobility-impaired individuals to engage in outdoor activities, providing independence and freedom at no cost. Unlike traditional wheelchairs, these track chairs, featuring tank-like tracks, can traverse various terrains. The chair is free to use and is available by reservation through the [David's Chair website](https://davidschair.org/).

When David Hartrick was diagnosed with ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease) in 2017, he decided to live what time he had left on his terms and find a way to continue to do the things he loved. An avid outdoorsman, David would need an all-terrain track chair to access the outdoor destinations he most loved, but the $20,000 price tag presented a significant challenge. David also wished for other individuals with mobility limitations to use the chair once he could no longer use it himself. David’s friends rallied around him and held a fundraiser to purchase the Action Track Chair, and David’s Chair was born.

<br>The David’s Chair is housed at the Coos Bay Visitor Center, along with a tow-and-go trailer to transport the chair. Thanks to the support of the local American Legion, Elks Lodge, and the City of Coos Bay, the beaches and trails on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** will be accessible to people of all abilities, allowing everyone to fully experience Oregon's Adventure Coast.

## New Options for Visitors with Hearing Impairments

Visitors with hearing loss will soon have access to hearing loops at The Coos Bay Visitor Center starting in August 2024. These assistive listening systems help individuals with hearing aids or cochlear implants to hear more clearly by transmitting sound directly to the hearing device via a magnetic field, reducing background noise and enhancing the clarity of the audio. Hearing loops are commonly installed in public spaces, such as theaters, places of worship, conference rooms, and service counters. This provides a valuable service for people with hearing loss to access clear audio in various environments.

We are committed to making Oregon’s South Coast more inclusive, striving to ensure that everyone can enjoy its majestic beauty, exciting outdoor activities, and welcoming communities.
