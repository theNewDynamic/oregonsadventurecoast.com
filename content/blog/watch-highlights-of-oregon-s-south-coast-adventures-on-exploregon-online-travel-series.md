The Coos Bay-North Bend Visitor and Convention Bureau was proud to once again host local media personality and Oregon travel guru, Rick Dancer to explore some of our favorite places and spaces and talk to some of our favorite people on Oregon's South Coast!

Dancer's online travel series, [*ExplOregon,*](https://www.facebook.com/ExplOregon-The-Back-Stories-110944429810670/) was back in the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area last month to help Oregon travelers discover even more adventures, interesting people and amazing local food. "Oregon's Adventure Coast is a place with recreation, farm to food restaurants, great beer and lots of things to do," Dancer writes in a recent post. "Oregon's South Coast is often overlooked, but once you see this, you will want to go for a visit because this is just a fraction of all Oregon's Adventure Coast has to offer."

*ExplOregon* is a unique series that uses live Facebook streams and real-time updates to take audiences on an interactive journey into different regions in our state. Watch this recap of *ExplOregon*'s latest venture into Oregon's Adventure Coast.

Rick Dancer has built a captive audience while traveling across our state and sharing his experiences on Facebook Live but he has a long history in local media. In 1985, he worked as a news anchor and reporter for KCBY TV and later moved to Eugene to be the main anchor for KEZI, where he stayed for 20 years. He also produces his own show, [*Get Real with Rick Dancer*](https://rickdancer.com/)*.*

“Rick has an amazing audience who follow him and his segments,” said Coos Bay-North Bend Visitor and Convention Bureau Director, Janice Langlinais in this [recent article](https://theworldlink.com/news/local/online-travel-series-rolls-into-town-to-show-off-what/article_69491aa8-4133-5050-9d22-9c19a9ba6005.html). “We are going to reach people who have probably never heard of Coos Bay or have never thought of coming to Coos Bay as a vacation destination. It helps us spread the word on how wonderful it is here.”

Back in July 2018, viewers got to experience[life on Oregon's Adventure Coast in real time](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/live-from-oregons-adventure-coast-25-experiences-with-that-oregon-life/) as they explored destinations like Coos Bay Farmers Market,&nbsp;Wildflour Café,&nbsp;Egyptian Theatre,&nbsp;7 Devils Brewery, Bastendorff Beach and Shore Acres State Park to name just a few!

If you are planning a trip to Oregon's Adventure Coast, these segments contain valuable tips that will inspire you to take the road less traveled and embark  on your own adventure!  Even if you weren't planning a trip, you'll probably want to when you see just how much fun our guests had.
