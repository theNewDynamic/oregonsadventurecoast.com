A fresh Dungeness crab meal is something every Oregon Coast visitor should experience during their stay. Many adventurous travelers enjoy catching their own Dungeness crab in the waters of lower Coos Bay for an unforgettable feast. We are following up on our <a href="/2014/12/when-where-and-how-to-find-the-best-dungeness-crab-on-oregons-coast/" target="_blank">local crabbing tips</a> with suggestions on how to enjoy your fresh catch!

To have your crab(s) cooked and cleaned for a reasonable fee, we recommend checking with local seafood/bait and tackle markets such as

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
<strong>Crab Shack</strong><br /> In addition to their seafood market which features freshly cooked crabs, visitors can rent crabbing equipment and bait. When you’re done crabbing they will clean and cook your crabs for you for a fee. Open daily 8am-6pm. 63840 Crossline Road Charleston, OR 97420 (541) 888-3433 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/charlestoncrabshack1/timeline" target="_blank" class="broken_link">www.facebook.com/charlestoncrabshack1</a>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
<strong>Fishermen’s Wharf</strong><br /> Floating market located just off “D” Dock in the Charleston boat basin. Pick your own Dungeness Crab from their live tank or one of their pre-cooked iced crab – done daily. They will cook and clean your catch.&nbsp;&nbsp; 63534 Kingfisher S-1 Charleston, OR 97420 541-888-8862 <a href="http://www.fishermenswharforegon.com/" target="_blank">www.fishermenswharforegon.com</a>
</p>

Keep your cooked crab refrigerated until ready to eat and follow these easy steps we found on the <a href="http://oregondungeness.org/consumer-info/cleaning-instructions/" target="_blank">Oregon Dungeness Crab Commission’s website</a>.&nbsp; Watch the below video for more tips.

* To remove the back, hold base of crab with one hand, place thumb under shell at mid-point, and pull off the shell.
* The leaf-like gills are now exposed. Gently scrape them away with thumb or spoon edge.
* Wash away the “crab butter” (viscera) under a heavy stream of cold water.

Oregon Dungeness crab is best when served warm, straight from the shell and dipped in drawn butter or seafood cocktail sauce. It also goes well with pasta, in casseroles and in seafood-based soups. Picked meat can be served chilled, Crab Louis or cocktail style as a delicious appetizer. <a href="http://oregondungeness.org/crab-recipes/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for some great recipes you can make with your fresh crab meat which include Soups & Appetizers, Sandwiches, Salads and Main Dishes.
