<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re headed to the Southern Oregon Coast, a day exploring the magnificent </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</span>](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/featured-adventures/the-dunes/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">is an absolute must.  Whether you enjoy an off-roading adventure on a quad or ATV, the serenity of hiking along the dunes and in the coastal forests, unlimited photo opps, horseback riding or camping-the opportunities for rest and relaxation are limitless in this magical destination.</span>

“Just the massiveness of this area is worth the stop,” writes a recent visitor on [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52034-d254248-r449430348-Oregon_Dunes_National_Recreation_Area-Reedsport_Oregon.html). “Just going there to sit in the sand and reflect on the beauty and the music that the ocean offers. The sunsets are breathtaking and it just gives you a chance to get away from all the hustle, noise, devices and crazy that our current lives offer. What an experience.”
