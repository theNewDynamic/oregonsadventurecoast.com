## Feast on Fresh Oregon Dungeness Crab at Charleston Merchants Crab Feed!

Better bring your appetite to Oregon's Adventure Coast the weekend of February 9th because the [35th Annual Charleston Merchants Crab Feed ]()is happening! This beloved annual event will be from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the [North Bend Community Center](). 

“The Oregon Dungeness Commercial Crab fishery is made up of men and women from coastal towns like Charleston, who care about good food and good crabbing,” says Tim Novotny, Oregon Dungeness Crab Commission, “The Charleston fleet is proud to contribute to its community in a variety of ways. Last year, they did so in the biggest of ways, by helping to bring in over $16 million dollars to the local economy through the Oregon Dungeness crab fishery. They also love to see people flock to events like this, because it helps to draw people to the restaurants and storefronts around Charleston – contributing even more to the local economy – while also enjoying the fruits of their hard work at the same time. Some come on down and have some fun in Charleston! We know you can’t help but crack a smile when you crack into our locally caught Oregon Dungeness crab.”

In honor of the occasion,  our friends at the Port of Coos Bay have created this guide to Crabbing in Charleston along with a delicious recipe for Crab Souffle developed by Margie Whitmer of The Wild Women of Charleston, OR.
