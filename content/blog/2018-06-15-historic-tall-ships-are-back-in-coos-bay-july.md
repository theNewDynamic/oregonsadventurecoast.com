<h2>See the historic Lady Washington and Hawaiian Chieftain at the Coos Bay Boardwalk July 12th-24th</h2>

The public is invited to experience maritime history when the brig <a href="http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/lady-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Washington</a> and the topsail ketch <a href="http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/hawaiian-chieftain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawaiian Chieftain</a> dock at the <a href="/our-area-coos-bay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coos Bay Boardwalk </a>July 12th-24th, 2018. This is welcome news to our community after the Lady Washington was unable to complete her voyage to Coos Bay in April due to weather conditions.

The <a href="http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/lady-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Washington </a>is a full-scale reproduction of the original Lady Washington, the first American vessel to make landfall on the west coast of North America in 1788. The <a href="http://historicalseaport.org/about-us/our-vessels/hawaiian-chieftain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawaiian Chieftain</a> is a replica of a typical European merchant trader of the turn of the nineteenth century. Her hull shape and rigging are similar to those of Spanish explorer’s ships used in the expeditions of the late 18th century along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.
