Whether it's winter, spring, summer, or fall, the towns of [<u>Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston</u>](/our-area) - a.k.a.

It’s also one of our favorite attractions on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, because there are plenty of opportunities to find relaxation and adventure. Take a thrilling ride up and down a towering sand dune, or hike along the miles and miles of trails. With more than 32,186 acres of dunes, forest, streams and lakes, there are plenty of opportunities for an amazing winter adventure.&nbsp;

**\#2 Go Mountain Biking**

**\#3 Explore the Beaches & State Parks Along the Cape Arago Highway**

![](/img/cape-arago-highway-winter-oregons-adventure-coast-blog-695x322-new.jpg)

There’s nothing quite as beautiful as the array of beaches and state parks along the Cape Arago Highway. The [<u>Cape Arago Beach Loop</u>](/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) will take you to three state parks (Sunset Bay State Park, Shore Acres State Park, and Cape Arago State Park), in addition to breathtaking beaches and vantage points.&nbsp; Take a walk and watch the surfers on Bastendorff Beach, or search for natural treasures in tide pools in the protected beach in Sunset Bay State Park. Watch the seal and sea lions on[<u> Simpson Reef and Shell Island</u>](/things-to-do/en/listings/126105-simpson-reef-and-shell-island-oregon-islands-nwr), part of the[<u> Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge</u>](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/oregon_islands/). Take in views of the ocean and stroll through the gardens at [<u>Shore Acres State Park</u>](/state-parks-and-national-lands/), the crown jewel of Oregon’s South Coast. The possibilities are endless!

Please do not touch the wildlife under any circumstances!&nbsp;

**\#4- Go Winter Storm Watching**

**![](/img/winter-storm-watching-oregons-adventure-coast-blog-695x322.jpg)**



If you are exploring [<u>the Cape Arago Beach Loop</u>](/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) during a high surf event, you will find multiple vantage points to watch the massive waves crash into the rugged coastline due to winter storms over the Pacific Ocean. The storm watching hut at Shore Acres State Park is one of the best storm watching spots on the Oregon Coast. Perched on top of an 80 foot cliff, this location allows for a safer distance above the waves while enjoying fantastic views. We will post High Surf Warnings on our[<u> Facebook Page</u>](https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast/), so be sure to follow us. Be “wave safe” and follow these important safety tips to keep everyone in your group safe:&nbsp;

* **Stay at a Distance**: Sneaker waves—unexpected waves that are far larger and more powerful than others—can sweep you off your feet with deadly consequences. A general rule is to stay at least 100 feet away from the water’s edge and NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THE OCEAN. If you want to pose for photos and/or a selfie, do it from a safe distance!&nbsp;
* **Avoid Walking on Logs, Jetties, and Cliff Edges**. Logs along the beach can become dangerous objects quickly during a sneaker wave. Jetties and cliff edges can also be slippery and unstable during stormy weather. A sudden large wave or gust of wind could lead to a fall. Stick to designated viewpoints and trails.

Pack those binoculars, because you’re in for a “fin-tastic” time this winter!

Thanks to their knowledgeable [<u>volunteers</u>](https://orwhalewatch.org/), curious visitors can learn more about the gray whales and their annual migration in [<u>designated sites</u>](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=7&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;mid=1GtewyAaPhNBWUDd6wbgUNClVkOM&amp;amp;ll=44.21568626913395%2C-124.2192685) (like [<u>Shore Acres State Park)</u>](/state-parks-and-national-lands/) between **10:00am - 1:00pm December 27-31, 2023.** If you’re unable to get to a designated viewing spot during Winter Whale Watch Week, you can still view these gentle giants on your own.
