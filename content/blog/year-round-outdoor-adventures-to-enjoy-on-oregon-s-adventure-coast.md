**\#4- Go Winter Storm Watching**

If you are exploring [<u>the Cape Arago Beach Loop</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) during a high surf event, you will find multiple vantage points to watch the massive waves crash into the rugged coastline due to winter storms over the Pacific Ocean. The storm watching hut at Shore Acres State Park is one of the best storm watching spots on the Oregon Coast. Perched on top of an 80 foot cliff, this location allows for a safer distance above the waves while enjoying fantastic views. We will post High Surf Warnings on our[<u> Facebook Page</u>](https://www.facebook.com/OregonsAdventureCoast/), so be sure to follow us. Be “wave safe” and follow these important safety tips to keep everyone in your group safe:&nbsp;

* **Stay at a Distance**: Sneaker waves—unexpected waves that are far larger and more powerful than others—can sweep you off your feet with deadly consequences. A general rule is to stay at least 100 feet away from the water’s edge and NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THE OCEAN. If you want to pose for photos and/or a selfie, do it from a safe distance!&nbsp;
* **Avoid Walking on Logs, Jetties, and Cliff Edges**. Logs along the beach can become dangerous objects quickly during a sneaker wave. Jetties and cliff edges can also be slippery and unstable during stormy weather. A sudden large wave or gust of wind could lead to a fall. Stick to designated viewpoints and trails.
