Whether you prefer to catch and cook your own or have an expert prepare them for you [Oregon’s Adventure Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/) has an abundance of options to try out the ever-popular Pacific Razor Clams. These clams have a mild and sweet brininess that is more delicate than other clams, making them perfect for chowder, steaks or fritters.

**If you’re looking to catch your own dinner, you should definitely enlist some help the first time.** [Basin Tackle](https://www.facebook.com/basintacklecharleston/) in Charleston offers a clam-digging ‘class’ and the equipment to set you up for success, they will even help you get your fishing license. For those of you who are brave enough to try it on your own or are already a seasoned pro, there are a few things you should know. You will need a fishing license, which you can find at a local [sporting goods store](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing-license-requirements/) or here: [https://myodfw.com/articles/where-crab-clam-coos-bay](https://myodfw.com/articles/where-crab-clam-coos-bay "https://myodfw.com/articles/where-crab-clam-coos-bay").

Also, the limit for razor clams is your first 15 dug, which means that you cannot throw the ugly ones back, keep your first 15 and you’re done; at least for the day.

**So, where are the best places to dig these tasty morsels?** Well, just about anywhere in our beautiful bay area; Bastendorff Beach, Charleston Boat Basin Sand Spit, Bay Point Landing, and the sandy beach along the inside of the North Jetty are among some of the more popular and easy to access spots.

Now, I know that some of you would rather let someone else do the heavy lifting, after all, you are on vacation! **There are several fresh, local options for delectable razor clams dishes.** [Tokyo Bistro](https://www.facebook.com/TOKYO-Bistro-296946263750139/) in the Historic Empire District serves them lightly panko breaded and fried to perfection. [Captain’s Choice](http://www.captainschoicefishhouse.com/) in North Bend, keeps this delightful delicacy on their menu year-round as well as [The Hilltop House](https://www.facebook.com/Hilltop-House-243331465858022/), overlooking the Bay.
