**Come on Down for a Doggone Good Time on Oregon’s Adventure Coast!**

_Spend a few days with us this fall and receive a_ [_15% discount at participating lodging properties_](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fall15/) _between October 1, 2021- November 30, 2021. Some restrictions apply and are subject to change._

Another Labor Day has come and gone on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**, and you may think to yourself, “Doggonit, summer is nearly over! What am I supposed to do now?”.

Well, friends, don’t fret! The fun is only beginning, as Oregon’s Adventure Coast is a year-round destination, and autumn is one of our favorite seasons! If you want to plan an extra special adventure, bring a furry family member or two along for the trip! We not only welcome dogs on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, we encourage them! Visitors will find many [pet friendly](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/dog-friendly-hotels-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) lodging options, services, and play areas in the Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston area. Guess you could say the “paw-sibbilites” are endless!

Here are eleven ways to enjoy Oregon’s Adventure Coast with your pet this fall (listed in no particular order). **Unless otherwise specified, please keep your pet on a leash in all public areas.**

![](/img/oregon-coast-dog-friendly-beaches-3.png)

**#1- Hike along the Cape Arago Loop Trail.**
There are plenty of [impressive hiking trails](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/hiking-walking/) to choose from on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, but this 6-mile round trip hiking trail takes you along the rugged coastline and through mysterious and beautiful coastal forests. Paths are wide enough that if you encounter other hikers, it’s easy to step aside and let them pass and still keep your distance.

**#2- Run Free Along an Open Beach!**
We love all our beautiful, undeveloped beaches here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. Our beaches are ideal for picnicking, walking/jogging, or simply spending a relaxing day tossing a ball or frisbee with your best friend. If your pup needs a good run, we recommend heading to [Horsfall Beach](https://www.campbase.com/horsfall-beach-campground) in North Bend and [Bastendorff Beach](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2017-08-29-spotlight-on-bastendorff-beach/) just outside of Charleston. Both locations have long stretches of beach for dogs to run and play. You can also find long stretches of beach, appealing coves to explore, and plenty of room to explore on Lighthouse Beach, and Whiskey Run Beach! **As a bonus, dogs are allowed off leash in specified areas, provided they are well-behaved and must be under the owner’s control at all times.**

![](/img/oregon-coast-dog-friendly-beaches-1.png)

TIP: Go during off-peak hours, like before 9 a.m. and/or on weekdays, to find even more open space.

\*_Visitors going to the beach should be aware of_ [_coastal safety hazards_](http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/PARKS/beach_tips.shtml) _with the potential danger of_ [_undertows_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertow_(wave_action))_,_ [_sneaker waves_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneaker_wave) _and_ [_rolling logs_](http://www.co.coos.or.us/Portals/0/Parks/BriefParkRules.pdf)_._*

**#3- Traverse Through Coastal Forests in the Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area.**
[Golden & Silver Falls State Natural Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2016-02-05-adventure-spotlight-golden-and-silver-falls/) (about 30 miles from Highway 101, on Highway 241) is the perfect destination for two-legged and four-legged adventure seekers alike! This destination has been called “a hidden gem in dense coastal forests” and takes hikers through scenic canyons and lush coastal forests to two magnificent waterfalls. Vantage points all along the trail give you excellent views of the falls from the bottom, mid-point, and top.

**TIP: Bring your camera, it’s the perfect place for a “pup-arazzi” photo shoot!**

**#4-** [**View the Abundance of Wildlife at Cape Arago State Park.**](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=66)
One mile south of Shore Acres, Cape Arago State Park has picnic tables and hiking trails that take you to a flat beach area. On a clear day, you can see for miles north and south. There are excellent opportunities to view tidepool life and the offshore colonies of seals and sea lions on Shell Island and Simpson Reef, part of the[ Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/oregon_islands/).

**#3- Wander Through the Scenic Trails and Waterways in the** [**South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR)**](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx)
This glorious nature preserve, located off Cape Arago Highway, on 7 Devils Road, near Charleston, covers 19,000 acres and offers miles of beautiful hiking trails and waterways to explore for all ability levels. Visitors say these trails are well maintained and relatively easy to hike - perfect for hiking with your best furry friend! SSNERR is also home to various marine life, plant and bird species - so be sure to bring binoculars with you! **_Please note that all dogs must be on a leash at all times._** [Visit the South Slough Reserve webpage for more information.](https://www.oregon.gov/DSL/SS/Pages/About.aspx) [Click here for the Estuary Study Trails map (pdf).](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Documents/south_slough_brochure_0415.pdf)

**#5- Grab a Bite or a Brew With Your Pup at a Dog-Friendly Restaurant.**
The restaurants on Oregon’s Adventure Coast not only offer delicious fare, many of them also welcome pets on their patio! Some local dog-friendly restaurants mentioned on [Bring Fido](https://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/city/coos_bay_or_us/) include [Blue Heron Bistro](http://www.blueheronbistro.net/), [7 Devils Brewing Co.](https://www.7devilsbrewery.com/#/), and[ High Tide Cafe](https://hightidecafeor.com/). We recommend calling ahead and finding out what options are available for your four-legged friend. [Download our Local Restaurant Guide](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/Restaurants-BOOKLET.pdf) to keep with you, or visit [Oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/) to see all our local restaurants.

**#6- Enjoy Picnic With Your “Fur-Ever Friend”**
Not sure if patio dining is right for you and your furry friend? Order takeout at any local restaurant and enjoy a lovely picnic outdoors! Visitors will find plenty of picnic tables in most city parks, like [Mingus Park](http://coosbay.org/departments/parks) in Coos Bay and [Simpson Park](https://kcby.com/news/local/new-playground-at-simpson-park-in-north-bend-its-a-good-place-for-kids) in North Bend. Picnic tables can also be found at any of the [Oregon State Parks and Natural Lands](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/), as well as the Coos Bay Boardwalk, the North Bend Boardwalk, in the Prefontaine Mural Plaza, and in other places throughout Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

**#7 Explore Oregon National Dunes Recreation Area**
For a truly unique adventure, there’s nothing like the [Oregon National Dunes Recreation Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/untamed-dunes/). This national treasure is the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America; 40 miles in all. Here are a few hiking trails you and your canine pal may enjoy exploring:

**Bluebill Trail** - Located off Horsfall Road in the Oregon National Dunes Recreation Area outside of North Bend, this trail loops around a seasonal lake, which is home to different species of birds and aquatic animals. Sometimes, it appears like a grassy meadow, and sometimes, lake waters lap at the boardwalks. Bring your camera and binoculars to view the sights. [Visit the USDA Forest Service website for Bluebill Trail information.](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recarea/?recid=42649)

[John Dellenback Dunes Trail ](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5427142.pdf)- Part of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area where motorized vehicles are prohibited. 2.7 Miles of the Dellenback trail leads to the beach, but the hike will appear longer as hikers tread soft, open sand. There is also an easier interpretive loop hike.

**#8- Embark on a Camping Adventure**
Are you going through a rough “pooch”? Outdoor enthusiasts have long known that camping is an excellent way to retreat into nature and [relieve stress and anxiety](https://www.justraveling.com/alternative-travel/how-camping-can-relieve-stress-anxiety/) - especially when traveling with your beloved pet(s)! There is no shortage of fabulous (and in most cases pet-friendly) [RV Parks & Campsites on Oregon’s Adventure Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/): Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston! You never know, a camping trip might be the perfect way to get a new “leash" on life!

**#9 Hike the** [**Oregon Coast Trail**](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.page&id=95)
Experts say it would take about 4 weeks to hike the full 362-mile Oregon Coast Trail, also known as the OCT. However, when you visit Oregon’s Adventure Coast, you and your canine can enjoy the coastline vistas, rolling hills and sandy beaches along the OCT - but in smaller sections.

**(Sunset Bay To Cape Arago)** Located off Cape Arago Highway through Charleston, you’ll find four miles of trails (one way) winding along one of the most spectacular coastlines in Oregon. From Sunset Bay, the trail winds around the coastal bluffs, offering spectacular views of the rugged Oregon coastline, past Shore Acres Botanical Gardens and Simpson Reef viewing area, to the captivating Cape Arago State Park. [Visit the Oregon Coast Trail website (Sunset Bay to Cape Arago,](https://www.oregon.gov/oprd/PARKS/Pages/OCT_main.aspx) Segment 7). [Click here for a trail map](https://shoreacres.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Trail-Map-Card-2016-web.pdf).

**Shore Acres Loop Hike- (Sunset Bay to Simpson Beach)** This section of the [Oregon Coast Trail](https://www.backpacker.com/trips/long-trails/oregon-coast-trail), open year-round, is considered one of the most beautiful hikes in the state of Oregon. Dense, coastal forests, rugged sandstone cliffs, and majestic vista points make this a popular destination for nature lovers and hikers of all levels. Be sure to bring a camera with you for all but certain wildlife photo opportunities you’ll encounter.

**#10- Stay in a Pet Friendly Hotel (there are lots!)**
After a big day exploring Oregon’s South Coast, you and your furry companion may feel a little “ruff” and need a good rest. Fortunately, there are many [pet-friendly hotels](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/dog-friendly-hotels-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) to choose from! However, we recommend booking your accommodations as early as possible and confirm the pet policy with the hotel!

**#11- Bask in Nature Along the** [**North Spit Trail**](https://www.alltrails.com/de/trail/us/oregon/north-spit-trail)
Spanning open sand dunes, wetlands, and forested islands, the incredible landscapes along the North Spit Trail will take your breath away. The best time to visit is between May and October. However, if you visit during winter and arrive after a storm, chances are you’ll be able to spot the Sujameco shipwreck which sank in 1929, as storms sometimes reveal the ship due to shifting sands. You’ll find more info [here](http://journeywithstevenmichael.blogspot.com/2010/07/sujameco-shipwreck.html).
