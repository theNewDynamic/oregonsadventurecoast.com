_Lighthouse hunting on Oregon’s Adventure Coast is an exciting and historic activity the whole family will enjoy._

**Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** has a long, rich maritime history dating back hundreds of years, and the lighthouses located up and down the Oregon coastline are special relics from that era that can still be seen today. These majestic beacons of light are a testament to the ingenuity and dedication of the early lighthouse keepers, who worked tirelessly to ensure the safety of mariners along the treacherous Oregon Coast. Not to mention they are beautiful to look at!

It's worth noting that **FIVE** out of the nine lighthouses in the state are within an hour's drive of Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston. In this post, we’re going to highlight these maritime wonders and we recommend you plan a road trip to visit all five in person!

## **#1 Cape Arago Lighthouse - Charleston, Oregon**

![](/img/cape-arago-lighthouse2-blog-695x322-jpg.jpg)

Standing at 44 feet, the Cape Arago Lighthouse near Charleston, Oregon is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the iconic sites travelers will see as they travel along t[he Cape Arago Beach Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/). The multiple vista points make it one of the most photographed lighthouses on the West Coast. The[ history of the Cape Arago Lighthouse](http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=129) dates back to 1866, when Coos Bay was one of the most active harbors on the West Coast, and there was a need for a lighthouse to guide ships carrying lumber and coal into our bay.

Though images of the lighthouse are posted everywhere, the lighthouse itself remains a mystery to many. It is no longer in operation, nor is it open to the public. And yet, it still has a commanding presence and simple beauty, making it the star of photographs and journals from travelers from around the world! Unfortunately, there is no public access to this lighthouse, but there are great views of it from Bastendorff Beach County Park, the Oregon Coast Trail, and the viewpoint on Cape Arago Hwy.

**How to Get There-** The Cape Arago Lighthouse is located just 12 miles southwest of Coos Bay/North Bend in Charleston. From Hwy 101, head west on Newmark Ave (near The Mill Casino * Hotel & RV Park), follow the road for 2.9 miles and turn left on Cape Arago Hwy. Once you cross the bridge into Charleston, continue straight onto Cape Arago Beach Loop, drive 8.6 miles for the Lighthouse viewpoint.

Today, this historic lighthouse is managed by Umpqua Valley Museums and is open for tours from May through September.

## Lighthouse Hunting Tips

* Dress in layers and bring warm clothing, even in summer and fall. The Oregon Coast temperature is known to fluctuate.
* Check the weather before you go. You will obviously get a much better view if you are going on a clear, sunny day. Is fog getting in the way? Don’t worry, it usually burns off once the sun comes out.
* Wear hiking shoes if you plan to get an even better view.
* If you plan to take pictures, bring a high-powered lens to get close-ups and/or binoculars.
