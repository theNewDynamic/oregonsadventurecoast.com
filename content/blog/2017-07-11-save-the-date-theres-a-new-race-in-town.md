### Be Among the First Runners to Participate in the Charleston Salmon Run and Crab Walk October 7th, 2017

There’s a reason why runners love to travel to Oregon’s South Coast. Not only is this home to one of Oregon’s greatest sports legends, the late  <a href="/about/prefontaine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Prefontaine</a>, our region is filled natural amenities ideal for training like challenging hills, trails, temperate weather and coastal beauty that can’t be found anywhere else in the country.

Every September, runners from all over the world travel here to compete in the <a href="http://prefontainerun.com/run-info.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Prefontaine Memorial Run</a>, a challenging 10K road race across one of Steve Prefontaine’s training courses here in Coos Bay. In addition, the [South Coast Running Club](http://www.southcoastrunningclub.org/), founded in the early 1970’s, organizes 10-12 annual events with attendance of 50-500 people.

Our newest addition to the annual race calendar, the [Charleston Salmon Run and Crab Walk](https://www.charlestonsalmonrun.com/), will kick off it’s first race on October 7th, 2017!  This unique race offers something for runners and non-runners alike.  Everyone from seasoned marathon runners to couch potatoes can benefit by participating.

The inaugural race will begin and end in Charleston Oregon. Participants will run along amazing scenic routes along rugged sea cliffs and sandy beaches. “As you wipe the sweat from your brow make sure you take a moment to soak in the beautiful scenery and listen for the sea lions bark,” it says on the event website. “They will be cheering you on.” Proceeds from the race will benefit Octoberfish, Bay Area Chamber of Commerce and Relay for Life.
