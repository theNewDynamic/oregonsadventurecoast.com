**HISTORY**

Once the luxurious private estate of timber and shipping tycoon, [Louis J. Simpson](https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/simpson_louis_j_1877_1949_/#.YDhAz-hKhaQ), Shore Acres has evolved into a beloved local treasure featuring a “garden for all seasons” for anyone to enjoy. The original plantings of Shore Acres were designed to take advantage of our mild climate. They featured exotic trees, shrubs, and flowering plants brought in from around the world by Simpson. The grounds contained five acres of formal gardens, including a Japanese-style garden built around a 100-foot lily pond to complement Mr. Simpson’s elaborate home. In 1942, Simpson’s beloved Shore Acres was purchased by the state of Oregon for use as a public park.
