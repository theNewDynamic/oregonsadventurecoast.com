**KCBS Sanctioned BBQ Competition.** One of the biggest draws of BBQ, Blues & Brews on the Bay is the fierce and flavorful competition! Dozens of top-tier BBQ teams from around the region will fire up their smokers and compete for a share of $15,000 in prize money.

After sampling $2–$6 bites from the competitors, visitors can drop their vote at the info tent, and the team with the most votes each day will win a $250 prize! It’s a delicious way to get involved, taste like a judge, and cheer on your favorite pitmasters.
