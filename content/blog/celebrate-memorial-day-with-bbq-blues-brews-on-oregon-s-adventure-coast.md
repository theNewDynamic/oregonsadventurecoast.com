![](/img/bbq-blues-brews-bay-blog-695x322-3.jpg)

**Savory BBQ (obviously).** Over two flavor-packed days, indulge in barbecue delights prepared by top regional pitmasters. As a special bonus, festivalgoers can savor creative Mac 'N Cheese dishes on Saturday and fresh local oysters on Sunday. Samples range from $2–$6 and are available from noon to 6 pm on Saturday and noon to 4 pm on Sunday—while supplies last!

**Plenty-o-Brews.** Sip and sample your way through three beer stations offering a wide selection of craft brews. Commemorative pint cups will be available for purchase, along with options for full-size pours or tasting-size samples—perfect for discovering a new favorite. Prefer wine? A thoughtfully curated selection will be available as well.

**Live Blues & Entertainment.** Set the tone for your BBQ weekend with live performances by local favorite [Blue Tide Blues Band](https://www.facebook.com/blue.tide.blues.band/) and the high-energy sounds of [Inner Limits](https://www.facebook.com/innerlimitsband/), blending blues, funk, and rock straight from Eugene. Between sets, a DJ will keep the music flowing, creating the perfect soundtrack for two fantastic days.

**Celebrity appearance by Champion Pitmaster Big Moe Cason.** Celebrity pitmaster and host of National Geographic’s World of Flavor,[Big Moe Cason](https://moecasonbbq.com/), will be back at BBQ, Blues & Brews on the Bay! Don’t miss your chance to meet the BBQ legend in person, grab a signed cookbook, and hear firsthand tips from one of the top names in the world of barbecue.

**KCBS Sanctioned BBQ Competition.** One of the biggest draws of BBQ, Blues & Brews on the Bay is the fierce and flavorful competition! Dozens of top-tier BBQ teams from around the region will fire up their smokers and compete for a share of $15,000 in prize money. Sanctioned by the Kansas City Barbecue Society (KCBS), this is no backyard cook-off—these competitors are judged by certified experts in four official categories: chicken, pork ribs, pork, and beef brisket. Contestants cook through the night, with turn-ins beginning at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday and culminating in an exciting awards ceremony at 4:15 p.m. in the event tent. Prizes will be awarded to the top 10 in each category, plus bonuses for the Grand Champion, Reserve Grand Champion, and Third Runner-Up.

***New for 2025:*** **A People’s Choice Vote** that gives festivalgoers a say! When guests purchase their entry pass, they’ll receive a voting slip to cast their vote for the team they think delivered the best BBQ of the day. After sampling $2–$6 bites from the competitors, visitors can drop their vote at the info tent, and the team with the most votes each day will win a $250 prize! It’s a delicious way to get involved, taste like a judge, and cheer on your favorite pitmasters.

**Also New for 2025: Cornhole for a Cause!** This year, visitors are invited to compete and support a great cause at the ["Cornhole for a Cause" Tournament](https://allevents.in/coos%20bay/bbq-blues-and-brews-cornhole-for-a-cause-camp-millennium/200028094715528), hosted by the [Coquille Community Cornhole League](https://www.facebook.com/groups/993325621302922/)during BBQ, Blues & Brews on the Bay.
