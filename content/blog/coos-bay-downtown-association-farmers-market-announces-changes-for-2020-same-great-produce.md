### Coos Bay Downtown Association Farmers Market Returns for 20th Season June 3, 2020

For nearly two decades, the opening of the[CBDA Farmers Market](https://coosbaydowntown.org/farmers-market/) has been a rite of spring that we have all looked forward to. The market, which typically operates Wednesdays from May through October, features fresh, locally grown produce, eggs, honey, meat, baked goods, coffee, and much much more. Not only has the CBDA Farmers Market served as a wonderful destination to buy fresh local food, for many years it has served as a true community gathering place here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

However, in order to comply with Oregon’s Phase 1 Reopening Plan, CDC Guidelines, and the Oregon Farmers Market Association (OFMA) our beloved downtown Farmers Market is going to operate a little differently this year in response to the global pandemic. Farmers Market Manager Melissa Hasart says this year, the market will open as an essential grocery-type layout not a “Social Gathering” site.

“The number one priority during the COVID-19 pandemic is everyone’s safety as we make farm fresh products available to our community in an open-air market,” she says. That means that at this time, there will be only essential vendors providing food offerings. Other market regulars including artists and craft, distributors and non-profits or educational booths will not be part of the market at this time. Social activities, children’s programs, entertainment, music, demonstrations or sampling of any products will not be happening this year.

The CBDA Farmers Market will still feature traditional homegrown and local essential products but market-goers can expect to see changes at the market including physical distancing and other practices. Shoppers will be encouraged to be safe, shop quickly and purchase only essential items. They will also be asked to wear fabric face coverings and thoroughly wash hands before coming to the market. Other things to consider include the following:

* Bring personal hand sanitizer.
* Send one healthy member of your household with a shopping list
* Leave pets and younger children at home (Service Animals are allowed)
* Remember to clean & wash all purchased produce at home before eating.

The CBDA Farmers Market will be doing their part to keep shoppers safe with new actions such as

* All staff, volunteers, and vendors are required to wear fabric face coverings and gloves, and vendors will have hand sanitizer at their booths.
* There will be Hand Washing Stations throughout the Farmers Market provided by Banner Bank
* Safety Greeters will be located throughout the market to encourage physical distancing.
* Vendors booths will be spaced at least 8 feet apart.
* Signs will be posted to “Shop with your Eyes”.
* There will be no customer contact with products prior to purchase.
* Food vendors will provide “Take Out” only and prepared food must be consumed off market premises.
* The Market is open to senior citizens and vulnerable customers only from 9am-10am

The CBDA Farmers Market is located on Central Avenue between Highway 101 South and 4th Street in downtown Coos Bay. It will be open every Wednesday from June 3rd through October 28th from 9:00 am until 2:00 pm with the first hour reserved for Seniors and customers with underlying health conditions and issues. The Market is made possible through generous sponsors including Jennie’s Shoes, Wildflour Catering, the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace, the Coos Head Food Coop and Banner Bank.
