**Why now?** Because it’s harvest season and you’d be supporting communities and local food growers. Because the producers & crafters you’ll meet along this trail will offer a unique and personalized experience you won’t find anywhere else. Because it’s an amazing opportunity to break out of your rut and try something new.
