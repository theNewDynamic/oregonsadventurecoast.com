The _Timeless Beauty from Reedsport to Brookings_ itinerary features multiple stops on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

“Further south in Coos Bay, stop in at Coos Head Food Co-Op for energy-packed snacks and beverages to take with you. Stroll the lush formal gardens at Shore Acres State Park and view dramatic surf crashing below the soaring cliffline. The trails in Cape Arago State Park provide breathtaking beauty of hidden coves and seascapes along the headland. Stop at Charleston’s Bayside Coffee Shop for organic fair trade coffee and tea and find refreshing smoothies made from house-made nut milks and fresh berries at Coos Bay’s Noster Kitchen.”
