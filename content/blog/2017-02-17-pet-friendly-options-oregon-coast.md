### Where are the best places for my pets to play?

Unless otherwise specified, keep your pet on a leash in public areas. However, if your pup needs a good run, we recommend heading to <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/horsfall-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horsfall Beach</a> in North Bend and <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/bastendorff-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bastendorff Beach </a>in Charleston. Both locations have long stretches of beach for dogs to run and play.  As an added bonus, dogs are allowed off leash provided they are well behaved and must be under owner’s control at all times.

Never, EVER leave your dog unattended. Even the most well-trained dog can get distracted; pay extra special attention to your surroundings and any potential situations that may cause your dog to wander or run off.

In addition to beach walks, the majority of our hiking trails are also super pet friendly.  Make sure you bring plenty of water for your furry friend (rule of thumb is 1 quart of water for your dog for every three miles you plan to hike). Travel Oregon has some great tips for travelers and their four legged friends. Read <a href="http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/oregon-stories/tails-trails-hiking-the-coast-with-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tails & Trails: Hiking the Coast with a Dog</a> if a hiking trip is part of your itinerary.

Oh, and this should go without saying, but please ALWAYS pick up after your pet! We like to keep our beaches and hiking trails clean and beautiful for all to enjoy.

## What about dining out?

There are some local restaurants like the <a id="link-448" href="http://www.blueheronbistro.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Heron Bistro</a> that allow pets on the patio. We recommend calling ahead and finding out what options are available for your four legged friend.

## Are there reliable pet sitting services available?

For the adventures that you can’t bring your pet along, there are a number of **pet sitting services** who can help out! Please keep in mind you should check in advance with care providers to see what pet records are required.

  * Carol’s Pet Sitting 541-297-6039
  * Morgan Veterinary 541-269-5846
  * Riverview Kennels (in Bandon) 541-347-4689
