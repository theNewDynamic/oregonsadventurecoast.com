For many of us, pets are an important part of the family and often make great traveling companions, especially when you are heading to Oregon’s Adventure Coast!  That’s why we welcome travelers AND their furry friends.

As a Pet Friendly destination, visitors will find numerous [pet friendly](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/dog-friendly-hotels-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) lodging options, services, and play areas in the Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston area.

### Where are the best places for my pets to play?

Unless otherwise specified, keep your pet on a leash in public areas. However, if your pup needs a good run, we recommend heading to [Horsfall Beach](https://www.campbase.com/horsfall-beach-campground) in North Bend and [Bastendorff Beach](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) in Charleston. Both locations have long stretches of beach for dogs to run and play.  As an added bonus, dogs are allowed off leash provided they are well behaved and must be under the owner’s control at all times.

Never, EVER leave your dog unattended. Even the most well-trained dog can get distracted; pay extra special attention to your surroundings and any potential situations that may cause your dog to wander or run off.

In addition to beach walks, the majority of our hiking trails are also super pet friendly.  Make sure you bring plenty of water for your furry friend (rule of thumb is 1 quart of water for your dog for every three miles you plan to hike). Travel Oregon has some great tips for travelers and their four legged friends. Read <a href="http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/oregon-stories/tails-trails-hiking-the-coast-with-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tails & Trails: Hiking the Coast with a Dog</a> if a hiking trip is part of your itinerary.

Oh, and this should go without saying, but please ALWAYS pick up after your pet! We like to keep our beaches and hiking trails clean and beautiful for all to enjoy.

## What about dining out?

There are some local restaurants like the <a id="link-448" href="http://www.blueheronbistro.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Heron Bistro</a> that allow pets on the patio. We recommend calling ahead and finding out what options are available for your four legged friend.

## Are there reliable pet sitting services available?

For the adventures that you can’t bring your pet along, there are a number of **pet sitting services** who can help out! Please keep in mind you should check in advance with care providers to see what pet records are required.

* Morgan Veterinary 541-269-5846
* Riverview Kennels (in Bandon) 541-347-4689
