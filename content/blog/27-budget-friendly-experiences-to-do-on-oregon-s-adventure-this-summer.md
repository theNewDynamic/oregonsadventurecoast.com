### Tips to Save $$

* Fill up before you go! These days, gas costs big bucks everywhere, but you’ll be more relaxed knowing you have a full tank and won’t have to stop at an unfamiliar gas station along the way.
* Drive the speed limit! Speeding increases fuel consumption, as gas mileage/fuel efficiency usually decreases rapidly at speeds above 50 miles per hour (mph). *Source:* [*US Department of Energy*](https://afdc.energy.gov/conserve/behavior_techniques.html#:~:text=Slow%20Down%20and%20Drive%20Conservatively,miles%20per%20hour%20&#40;mph&#41;.)
* Look for restaurant specials. There are numerous local restaurants dishing out the freshest seafood and chowder you could hope for. Ask about discounts and specials!. [Download our Local Restaurant Guide](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/Restaurants-BOOKLET.pdf) to carry with you, or visit [Oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/dining/) to see all our local restaurants
* Hotels often fill up in the summer months, so be sure to book your accommodations as far in advance as possible. If a hotel stay is not in your budget, consider a camping trip in one of our amazing camping destinations like Sunset Bay State Park Campground, Bluebill Campground, Bastendorff Beach County Park, Horsfall Beach OHV Campground, Box Car Hill Campground, Riley Ranch County Park, Spinreel Campground and many more. [Click here](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/) to a list of all campgrounds, hotels and RV Parks.
* Pack a lunch or snacks for the road trip to save you $$ while traveling. There are plenty of picnic destinations to visit along the way.
* If applicable, bring current membership cards with [AAA](https://oregon.aaa.com/), [AARP](https://www.aarp.org/) [NARM](https://narmassociation.org/), [AAM](http://www.aam-us.org/home) or [AASLH](http://www.aaslh.org/) and don’t be afraid to show it! Some local businesses and museums may offer a discount to members.
