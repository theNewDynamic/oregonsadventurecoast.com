What do hiking through [Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2016-02-05-adventure-spotlight-golden-and-silver-falls/), spotting rare [shorebirds](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/birding-and-wildlife/) in their natural habitat, discovering a beautiful [work of art](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/art-history-culture/), and watching a magnificent sunset on a [beautiful beach](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) have in common? If you guessed "things you can do on Oregon’s Adventure Coast," you’re right!

But these experiences share something even more powerful—they evoke awe, a feeling of wonder and amazement in response to something vast or inspiring. And awe isn’t just a beautiful experience—it also offers proven health benefits for both mind and body.

The demands of modern life make it difficult to prioritize self-care and mental health. However, regular doses of awe—like those found in nature therapy or "forest bathing"—can help reduce stress and enhance well-being.

[Forest bathing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/forest-bathing/), or Shinrin-yoku, is a Japanese practice that immerses oneself in nature and engages all five senses to foster a deeper connection with the environment. This practice inspires a sense of awe, which has been shown to lower stress, improve mood, and boost the immune system. Research confirms that time in nature reduces cortisol (the stress hormone) and increases serotonin (the happiness hormone), promoting overall mental and physical health.
