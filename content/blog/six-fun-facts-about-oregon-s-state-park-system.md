State Parks Day is an annual event that falls on the first Saturday in June. The Oregon State Legislature established the free day in 1997 to thank Oregonians for their support and focus public attention on Oregon's state park system. This year, State Parks Day will be celebrated June 1, 2024, with free parking and events throughout the state. The weekend of June 1-2, 2024 is also a [Free Fishing Weekend](https://myodfw.com/articles/2024-free-fishing-days-and-events) in Oregon, so you won’t need a license to fish, crab or clam anywhere in the state.

To mark its 102nd anniversary, here are six fun facts about Oregon's State Park System that might help you appreciate them even more:

![](/img/oregon-state-parks-blog-695x322-jpg-1.jpg)

**\#1- The Oregon State Park system is one of the most popular state park systems in the country.** If you have ever visited an Oregon State Park, it should come as no surprise that our state park system is among the most respected state park systems in the United States. In fact, it consistently ranks in the top 10 most visited state park systems in the nation. According to data released by the [Oregon Parks and Recreation Department](https://www.oregonlive.com/travel/2024/03/oregon-state-parks-saw-near-record-crowds-in-2023-these-were-the-busiest-spots.html), the Oregon State Parks welcomed 52,231,692 daytime visitors and 2,909,175 overnight campers statewide in 2023 (that’s A LOT)! ***State Parks on the Oregon Coast accounted for seven of the top 10 day-use parks and eight of the top 10 campgrounds last year.***

**\#2- The Oregon State Park system is one of the largest in the United States.** According to the National Association of State Park Directors (NASPD), there are 6,792 state park units in the United States. California currently has the most state parks in the country with 280 parks, followed closely by Oregon with a whopping 250+ parks, including camping at more than 50 parks, on more than 113,000 acres. From rugged coastline and towering forests to pristine lakes and cascading waterfalls, the system offers a diverse range of landscapes to explore and enjoy. “Oregon is so lucky to have an incredibly diverse park system,” says Stephanie Knowlton, Public Information Officer with Oregon State Parks in [this recent Oregon Public Broadcasting article](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/03/10/oregon-state-parks-has-another-year-of-record-visitation/). “And, so we’re encouraging people to maybe look at some parks that don’t get as much visitation and see if they will find a new favorite out there.”

**\#3- Oregon's State Park System has been around for more than a century.** When one thinks of Oregon State Parks, many do not know that there is a rich history dating back to the early 20th century. It all began when Sarah Helmick, an Oregon Trail pioneer, marked her 100th birthday by donating a portion of her family homestead along the Luckiamute River in Polk County to preserve the land for future generations. This 5-acre donation became Oregon’s first official state park, and the Oregon State Park System was born. Since then, the system has grown to encompass more than 250 parks, historic sites, and recreation areas, preserving the state's natural and cultural heritage for future generations.

**\#4- Oregon State Parks are renowned and widely respected for their environmental stewardship.** From the very beginning, the Oregon State Park system has remained committed to environmental stewardship and sustainability, implementing initiatives to protect and preserve the state's natural resources, and promoting eco-friendly practices among visitors and staff. Public Information Officer, Stephanie Knowlton says that parks staff and rangers work hard to keep parks clean and safe, and park users can help. “Visitors can also participate in making it a safe and clean space by respecting park rules and also making sure they leave no trace,” she said. “And, in addition to that, if they have an opportunity, even thanking park rangers for all that they do really goes a long way.”
