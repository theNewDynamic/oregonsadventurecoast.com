Pick up a free Southern Oregon Coast Charm Trail map (or [download it here](/img/Charm-Trail-Map.pdf) ) then plan a visit to as many (or all) participating venues on the map and add other charms for $2.00 each. Make sure you get one of our super cute crab charms and be on the lookout for any other hidden treasures as you make your way on the trail. We have a hidden charm too! Can you guess what it is? (you can even download the map to all the [hidden charms here](/img/Charm-Trail-Map-Hidden-Charm-Map.pdf).)
