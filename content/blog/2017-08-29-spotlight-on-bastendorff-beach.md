  just to hang out?" While there are several, we frequently direct our visitors

One of the most common questions visitors ask is "Where's a great beach to just to hang out?" While there are several, we frequently direct our visitors to [Bastendorff Beach](http://www.co.coos.or.us/Departments/CoosCountyParks/Bastendorff.aspx), located 1/4 mile off the [Cape Arago State Highway](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/), about two miles west of Charleston.

This beautiful undeveloped beach is never crowded makes you feel as if you've entered a different world, even though you're only minutes from town. The beach is ideal for picnicking, walking/jogging, bonfires or just spending a relaxing day perched on a beach chair gazing at the sea. It's a favorite among surfers, kiters, campers, beachcombers and locals and tourists alike.

We could say more, but this video by <a href="https://www.blm.gov/oregon-washington" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bureau of Land Management</a> does an excellent job demonstrating why Bastendorff Beach is a must see for beach enthusiasts.&nbsp;*Note:&nbsp;Visitors going to the beach should be aware of&nbsp;[coastal safety hazards](http://www.oregon.gov/OPRD/PARKS/beach_tips.shtml)&nbsp;with the potential danger of&nbsp;[undertow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertow_&#40;wave_action&#41;)[s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertow_&#40;wave_action&#41;),&nbsp;[sneaker waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneaker_wave)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.co.coos.or.us/Portals/0/Parks/BriefParkRules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rolling logs</a>.*

<p>Overlooking Bastendorff Beach is the spacious 89 acre <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/bastendorff-beach-county-park/">Bastendorff County Park Site</a>, one of our most popular local campgrounds. Campers love the amenities, convenience, gorgeous view of the ocean and the fact that is family friendly. Surrounded by large trees and coastal foliage, campers have access to a fish cleaning area, picnic areas, tent sites, cabins, public phones, drinking water, a playground and more.</p>
<p>If overnight camping isn't your thing, &nbsp;you can still enjoy the park and it's day-use area that includes picnic sites with gazebo-like shelters (shelters can be reserved) equipped with charcoal grills, (must provide own charcoal) electric outlets, electric four-burner stovetops, and kitchen sinks with cold running water. &nbsp;Day "campers" can also enjoy a game of softball and volleyball &nbsp;in addition to a fire pit, barbecue, horseshoe court, basketball court, and much more.</p>
