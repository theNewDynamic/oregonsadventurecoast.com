***“Beyond their visual appeal, murals can create a sense of safety and belonging, turning public spaces into places where people feel connected.”*** **\- Steven Micheal, Coos Bay Photographer/Author**

Murals have a way of catching you off guard. You are out and about to grab a cup of coffee, or heading out for a day of fishing, and suddenly there it is. A story on a wall. A moment frozen in paint. A reminder that creativity lives right alongside everyday life.

Local photographer, Steven Michael, recently photographed many of these artistic treasures located throughout Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston and [shared them in this post.](https://pacificnorthwestadventures.weebly.com/blog/oregons-adventure-coast-city-murals) “Murals carry rich symbolism and serve many meaningful purposes,” he says.“Beyond their visual appeal, murals can create a sense of safety and belonging, turning public spaces into places where people feel connected.”

That sense of connection is not hard to find on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston. Artists have long been drawn to our corner of the Pacific Northwest, inspired by the landscape, the working waterfront, and the people who call it home. Over time, those artists have left their mark in a very public way.

To help visitors explore the many public art treasures along the Oregon Coast, the [Oregon Coast Visitors Association](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/) created a [Public Art Trail map](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/oregon-coast-public-art-trail/) that highlights murals, sculptures, and installations. You can follow the entire route or pick a section and wander at your own pace.

Many visitors already know about the unique network of [museums and galleries in Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/art-history-culture/). What often comes as a surprise is how much art lives outdoors, woven into neighborhoods, businesses, and gathering spaces. Here are just a few places to start looking.

A special thanks to Steven Michael for allowing us to share some of his photography and research in our post. **For a more complete list with images, be sure to visit Steven Michael’s post,** [Oregon's Adventure Coast - City Murals](https://pacificnorthwestadventures.weebly.com/blog/oregons-adventure-coast-city-murals)**.**

### **Murals of North Bend**

1 - Crossing into North Bend, one of the first murals many visitors encounter is at the [Itty Bitty Inn](https://ittybittyinn.com/)on Sherman Avenue. Owned by Rik Villarreal, the inn is known for its playful personality and retro spirit, and the murals match that energy. Painted by Simon Whiteowl, the exterior features themes inspired by Star Wars, Star Trek, Bigfoot, and the outdoors. It is fun, unapologetically quirky, and a perfect introduction to North Bend’s creative side.

2 - A few blocks away, the Boom Tender Mural offers a more historical perspective. Painted in 1991 by artist Peggy O’Neal, it depicts the dangerous work of boom tendering, when workers balanced on floating logs to sort and prepare timber for shipment. The mural honors a tough job that shaped the local economy and continues to resonate today. While the mural sits in a privately owned courtyard, it is easily viewed from the sidewalk along Highway 101.

### **Murals of Coos Bay**

1- One of the most recognizable murals in Coos Bay is the [Prefontaine Memorial Mural](https://prefontainerun.net/pre-murals/), located on the north-facing wall at 275 South Broadway along Highway 101 (also known as "Pre-Way" Plaza). Dedicated to legendary runner Steve Prefontaine, the mural honors his roots in the community and stands as a point of pride downtown. It is hard to miss and worth slowing down for.

![Large black and white mural spanning three building walls showing a runner at different stages of his career, including two close up portraits of Steve Prefontaine on either side and a full body image of him running on a track in the center, with an inspirational quote painted above the central figure.](/img/prefontaine-mural.jpg "The Steve Prefontaine Murals in downtown Coos Bay, Oregon")

**Bonus:** While you are visiting the mural, take a moment to grab a selfie with *Belle*, a [Washed Ashore](https://www.washedashore.org/) plastic bottle jellyfish sculpture displayed near the mural. Be sure to also keep an eye out for the “Running Man” bike racks in the area. These playful, functional art pieces were created by the Marshfield High School Manufacturing Class and installed in 2021, adding yet another fun layer of creativity to the experience.

![Black metal “Running Man” bike rack shaped like a runner’s legs installed in a small plaza in downtown Coos Bay, with the Steve Prefontaine memorial mural visible on the building wall in the background.](/img/running-man-bike-racks-coos-bay-oregon.jpg "Black metal “Running Man” bike rack shaped like a runner’s legs installed in a small plaza in downtown Coos Bay, with the Steve Prefontaine memorial mural visible on the building wall in the background.")

2- A short distance away, the [Coos Bay Shipping Mural](https://nbc16.com/news/local/mural-between-cities-of-north-bend-and-coos-bay-gets-finishing-touches-from-city-officials) tells a very different story. Painted by artist Mike Vaughn, this large-scale work celebrates the [Port of Coos Bay](https://www.portofcoosbay.com/) and its history as a major lumber shipping hub. Tugboats, ships, and industrial details reflect a time when timber from this region traveled around the world. Originally sketched in the late 1980s, the mural was brought to life in full color in 2015, blending history with renewed energy.

![Close-up detail of the Coos Bay Shipping Mural showing a painted tugboat labeled “Koos King Coos Bay Ore” moving through stylized blue and white water on a building wall.](/img/coos-bay-shipping-mural-1.jpg "Close-up detail of the Coos Bay Shipping Mural showing a painted tugboat labeled “Koos King Coos Bay Ore” moving through stylized blue and white water on a building wall.")

3 - Another unexpected stop is the Library Native Flower Mural near the [Coos Bay Library](https://www.coosbaylibrary.org/). Designed by artist Megan Gray and painted with help from community volunteers, the mural features native Pacific Northwest flowers labeled with both common and scientific names. It is educational, approachable, and a great example of how public art can invite people to learn while they look.

### **Murals in Coos Bay’s Empire District**

1 - In the [Empire District of Coos Bay](https://www.coosbayor.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1640/222), the Empire Welcome Mural stands as a celebration of local history. Painted by Simon Whiteowl in 2021, the mural stretches across the west wall of the Star of Hope Building at Newmark Avenue and South Wall Street. Each letter in the word Empire contains a different scene, from tribal canoes to the Cape Arago Lighthouse, creating a visual timeline of the community’s past.

![Large colorful “Empire” welcome mural painted on a building wall in the Empire District of Coos Bay, with each letter illustrating scenes of local history, waterfront views, and community landmarks along a street corner.](/img/empire-welcome-mural-coos-bay.jpg "Large colorful “Empire” welcome mural painted on a building wall in the Empire District of Coos Bay, with each letter illustrating scenes of local history, waterfront views, and community landmarks along a street corner.")

![Close-up detail of the Empire Welcome Mural showing the letter “P” filled with a painted scene of the Hollering Place pier in the Empire District of Coos Bay, with a wooden walkway extending over the water beneath a colorful sky.](/img/empire-mural-3-p.jpg "Close-up detail of the Empire Welcome Mural showing the letter “P” filled with a painted scene of the Hollering Place pier in the Empire District of Coos Bay, with a wooden walkway extending over the water beneath a colorful sky.")

2 - Nearby, the 101 Ship Wall Murals transform once-overlooked brick walls into bold maritime scenes. Painted by Mike Vaughn, the murals resemble the hulls of ships and feature named tugboats guiding vessels safely to port. What was once an eyesore has become a point of interest that reflects the area's working spirit.

### **Murals of Charleston, Oregon**

1 - In Charleston, art often appears where you least expect it. One favorite is the Jetty Mural tucked into a grassy alley in the Charleston Boat Basin. It feels like a discovery, rewarding those who wander just a little off the main path.

![Jetty mural in Charleston, Oregon depicting fishing boats navigating rough water near a forested shoreline and rocky cliffs, painted across the exterior wall of a building.](/img/jetty-mural-charleston-oregon.jpg "Jetty mural in Charleston, Oregon depicting fishing boats navigating rough water near a forested shoreline and rocky cliffs, painted across the exterior wall of a building.")

2 - Charleston is also home to the [Plainview Motel and RV Park](https://www.plainviewmotel.com/) mural collection. Spread throughout the property are nearly twenty murals painted by Simon Whiteowl, many inspired by ocean life, forests, and regional landmarks. Walking the grounds feels less like staying at a motel and more like strolling through an outdoor gallery.

![Whale mural at the Plainview Motel and RV Park in Charleston, Oregon showing three large whales painted in shades of blue and gray across a building wall with windows integrated into the artwork.](/img/plainview-motel-and-rv-park-mural-collection.jpg "Whale mural at the Plainview Motel and RV Park in Charleston, Oregon showing three large whales painted in shades of blue and gray across a building wall with windows integrated into the artwork.")

### **Art With a Message**

Public art on Oregon’s Adventure Coast is not only about beauty or history. It is also about awareness. [Washed Ashore](https://www.washedashore.org/) sculptures, made from marine debris collected on Oregon beaches, appear in downtown Coos Bay and other nearby locations. Shaped like sea creatures, these pieces are meant to spark conversation about plastic pollution and ocean health. They are eye-catching, thought-provoking, and hard to forget. Visitors can see these unique pieces with a powerful message at a new location in Pony Village Mall in North Bend and, as mentioned above, the Pre-Way Plaza in downtown Coos Bay (near the murals).

### **Go Find the Stories**

These murals are only a small sampling of the art waiting to be discovered across Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston. Some are easy to spot from the road. Others require a little curiosity and a willingness to explore.
