<h3>Harvest Moon Evening Paddle Trip</h3>
The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve invites you to experience the South Slough like never before Wednesday, October 4th from 3- 8pm as the sun slips behind the horizon and the full moon climbs into the evening sky. Awaken the senses as light and shadows play on the water and the air is filled with a chorus of creatures settling down at twilight.

During the five mile paddle, experienced guides will show you areas of the Reserve rarely seen by visitors. Bring your own kayak or canoe, paddles, PFDs, headlamp or waterproof flashlight, as well as water and evening meal. Feet and legs may get wet and muddy at launch points. Driver and shuttle will be provided. Meet at the Distant Water Fleet Parking Lot in Charleston, OR [Min-3 boats/Max-14]($20/boat)
