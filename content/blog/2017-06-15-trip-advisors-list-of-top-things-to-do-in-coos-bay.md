### What Coos Bay Attractions Are The Most Popular Among TripAdvisor Users?

The [Coos Bay](/towns/coos-bay/), [North Bend](/towns/north-bend/) and [Charleston](/towns/charleston/) area is known as Oregon’s Adventure Coast for good reason!

Each community has it’s own unique flavor and amenities with the Pacific Ocean and the Coos Bay waterways as its backdrop. When exploring Coos Bay, visitors are treated to fantastic local restaurants, gourmet coffee houses, museums, antique shops, gift shops and much more.

There’s far too much to do in our area to list in just one blog post, but we would like to highlight a few of the local attractions that visitors to our area recommend the most on the popular travel site, [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g51813-Activities-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html). Even though some  of the attractions listed are located in North Bend & Charleston, this list will give you an idea of the places and spaces that visitors seem to love the most in the Coos Bay area:

### #1 State Parks

With it’s majestic views, easy accessibility and variety of available activities, it’s no surprise that Shore Acres State Park & Cape Arago State Park are the most recommended local attraction.

### #2 Cranberry Sweets

When it comes to satisfying your “sweet tooth”, there’s no place quite like Cranberry Sweets, a candy manufacturer/retailer with stores in Bandon and Coos Bay, Oregon. It’s a favorite among locals and visitors, so it’s no surprise to see them on TripAdvisor’s list. Visitors to their store are often rewarded with a variety of irresistible in store samples.

### #3 McCullough Memorial Bridge

This one surprised us a bit because we haven’t considered the bridge to be an activity. However, it turns out visitors love this local landmark band never seem to tire of traveling over it as they enter “Oregon’s Adventure Coast”.

### #4 Coos Bay Boardwalk

Visitors and locals will often take a stroll on this beautiful downtown destination as they overlook the Coos Bay waterway. Since Coos Bay is the deepest working port between Seattle and San Francisco, it’s not uncommon to see cargo ships along with fishermen, kayakers and windsurfers among other things.

### #5 Three Rivers Casino
