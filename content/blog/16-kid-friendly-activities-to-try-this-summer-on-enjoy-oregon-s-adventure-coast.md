**\#1-Explore Local Beaches and State Parks along Cape Arago Highway.** For a fun-filled day of exploring the best of the Oregon Coast, we recommend a drive along the [Cape Arago Highway Loop](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/). It’s a wonderful way to explore [beautiful beaches,](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/undeveloped-beaches/) along with [some of the best state parks in Oregon](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/), including Sunset Bay State Park, Shore Acres State Park, and Cape Arago State Park. Whether you’re in the mood for a beach stroll, wildlife viewing, or searching for natural treasures in tide pools, this kid-friendly activity has it all!

Enjoy a picnic or fly a kite on Bastendorff Beach, or go tide pooling in the protected beach in Sunset Bay State Park. Watch the seals and sea lions on Shell Island from the overlook at[Simpson Reef](https://www.shareoregon.com/things-to-do/en/listings/126105-simpson-reef-and-shell-island-oregon-islands-nwr), part of the[Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/oregon_islands/).

**\#2-Get out on the water.** With so many lakes, rivers, bays, estuaries and more, Oregon's Adventure Coast is the gateway to some of the best outdoor fun on the Oregon Coast. Depending on your children’s age(s), you may choose from water recreation options like kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding, surfing, and even water skiing! Don’t have your own kayak, paddleboard, or surfboard? You can rent one and get expert advice from our friends at [Waxer’s Surf Shop](https://waxerssurfandskate.com/) in downtown Coos Bay; [Bahama Boards](https://bahamaboardz.com/)in Coos Bay; and [Coastal Kayak & SUP Rentals](https://coastalkayakandsuprentalsllc.com/) in the Empire District of Coos Bay.
