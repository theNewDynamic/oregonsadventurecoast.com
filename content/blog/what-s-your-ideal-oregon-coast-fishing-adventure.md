### _There are plenty of fish in the sea on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston, and plenty of ways to catch them!_

Fishing is much more than just a sport or a pass time on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston**. It’s a way of life. Our communities have a long history of welcoming anglers of all backgrounds and skill levels who have traveled here for world class fishing that can’t be experienced anywhere else. With the bay, ocean, and 30+ freshwater lakes and rivers, our area is a prime destination for all sorts of fishing adventures - whether it’s from the shore, charter boat, jetty, bridge, and even by kayak.

The question is, what’s your [fishing style](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing-by-style/)? Do you prefer [saltwater fishing](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay/) or [freshwater fishing](http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/trip-ideas/fresh-water-fishing-options-by-body-of-water/)? [Crabbing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/crabbing-clamming/) & [Clamming](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/clamming/)? What about [kayak fishing](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/kayak-fishing-on-the-south-coast/)? To help you discover our exhilarating adventures, we have put together a list of different ways to embark on an epic fishing adventure to suit your family, your lifestyle, and the time of year you will be traveling.

_**Unless it is a_ [_Free Fishing Weekend_](https://myodfw.com/articles/2022-free-fishing-days-and-events)_, a fishing license (or a shellfish license for clamming) is required for those aged 12 years or older. Daily licenses are available. Most fishing charters, bait shops and sporting goods stores can supply these for you. You can purchase a shellfish or a fishing license locally in stores like Bi-Mart, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Fred Myer, the ODFW Office (licenses only) in Charleston and Walmart._ [_Click here_](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing-license-requirements/) _to see the fishing license requirement and/or_ [_information about a shellfish license._](https://www.oregon.gov/oda/programs/foodsafety/shellfish/pages/clamsmussels.aspx)_**_

### What’s Your Ideal Fishing Adventure?

Deciding on the type of fish you want to catch will play a huge role in where you will fish. If you’re looking for trout, your best bet will be to stick to the lakes that have been stocked with trout. Is it Surfperch you want? You’ll want to hit one of our beaches, like Bastendorff Beach, Horsfall Beach and Cape Arago State Park. Want to go digging for clams? Clamming is excellent during low tides near Charleston, Coos Bay, off Cape Arago Highway, and Clam Island. Whether it’s bass, salmon, trout or tuna - anglers can find a range of fish here. Here are some species commonly caught here:

* SALMON FISHING. Most Pacific salmon fishing occurs April through November, and state and federal agencies regulate sport seasons for Coho and Chinook salmon. The Fish and Wildlife Commission has set the 2022 ocean salmon seasons. See [this year's ocean salmon seasons](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/mrp/salmon/Regulations/docs/2022_Ocean_Sport_Salmon_1_page.pdf).
* HALIBUT FISHING. [Pacific halibut](https://myodfw.com/pacific-halibut-sport-regulations) is not a bottom fish species; it is managed with its own allocation and regulations. Halibut is a spring and early summer fishery. You can find more 2022 season dates and regulations on the ODFW’s [Sport Halibut Season Page](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/news/2022/04_Apr/042522.asp#:\~:text=Nearshore%20season%3A%20Open%20daily%20beginning,9%20and%20July%2021%2D23.).
* ALBACORE TUNA. Fishing for Albacore Tuna has typically been best in late July, August, and sometimes into September, but anglers travel 20-30 miles offshore to find the best fishing.
* BOTTOMFISH. Bottomfish are available year round – weather permitting – and a charter trip usually ends with an ice chest full of fish. We recommend checking with the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife for the most up-to-date recreation report for bottom fish catch limits. More information can be found on the [sport bottom fish seasons page](https://myodfw.com/sport-bottomfish-seasons).
* RAINBOW TROUT. [Rainbow trout](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/docs/odfwoutdoorstroutfishing.pdf) are stocked into the lakes, and the lakes are open all year. Bluebill Lake, Bradley Lake, Butterfield Lake, Eel Lake, Empire Lakes, Sru Lake, Powers Park Pond, Saunders Lake, Tenmile Lakes.
* CRABBING. [Crabbing on Oregon’s Adventure Coast ](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/crabbing-clamming/?utm_source=adventure-february-2021&utm_medium=mailchimp&utm_campaign=cbnb-newsletter)can be done year-round off the docks, and anyone can easily rent or buy the necessary [equipment](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/equipment-rent-and-buy/?utm_source=adventure-february-2021&utm_medium=mailchimp&utm_campaign=cbnb-newsletter). Here are a few tips we want to share from the [Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife](https://myodfw.com/articles/how-crab). Be sure to read their [instructional flier How to Crab](https://www.dfw.state.or.us/resources/fishing/docs/CrabbingFlyer.pdf) for important details.
* CLAMMING. Home to numerous bays, Coos Bay is an ideal destination for clamming. We expect tides to be ideal for clamming well into summer and even fall! [Click here for ODFW's Regulations Summary for Marine Shellfish,](https://myodfw.com/articles/oregon-shellfish-regulations) and read [Clamming on Oregon’s Adventure Coast](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/clamming/?utm_source=adventure-february-2021&utm_medium=mailchimp&utm_campaign=cbnb-newsletter) for more information.

After answering some key questions (like what kind of fish you’re after) and doing a bit of research, you’ll have a good idea of where you want to go.

**KAYAK FISHING**

Kayak fishing offers unsurpassed views of natural habitats and scenery that can only be found deep in the lakes, rivers and open water along the Pacific coastline. Many will say they are drawn to this watersport for its ease and simplicity. Kayak fishing is accessible to all skill levels and does not require expensive equipment. Renting a kayak on Oregon’s Adventure Coast can be done by visiting one or more of these local businesses:

* [Waxer’s Surf Shop in Coos Bay](https://waxerssurfandskate.com/) is a great place to rent a quality kayak and other sports gear and equipment from helpful, knowledgeable staff members.
* [Bahama Boards in Coos Bay ](https://bahamaboardz.com/coos-bay-shop/)is a fantastic place to purchase or rent kayaks and paddle boards, in addition to gear, clothing, and accessories you may need as you explore the Pacific ocean waters, lakes and rivers!
* [Canoas Bay Bridge Rentals ](https://canoasport.wixsite.com/baybridgerentals)in North Bend also offers kayak rentals and other fishing necessities. For added convenience, you can also book a room at their Bay Bridge Motel!

If you are looking for the best spot for kayak fishing, look no further than [Sunset Bay State Park](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/adventure/state-parks-and-national-lands)! Known for its calm waters and easy access to the beach, Sunset Bay State Park is an ideal location for kayak anglers who want to head offshore into the ocean in search of cabezon, lingcod, and halibut. Other ideal destinations for kayak fishing include Empire Lakes in Coos Bay, Siltcoos or Ten Mile lakes (great for bass, trout and perch); and the Umpqua, Coos or Coquille rivers are perfect detinations for kayakers searching for chinook salmon.

**SURF FISHING**

If casting your line from shore sounds appealing, you can choose from many locations for [surf fishing,](https://myodfw.com/articles/how-fish-surfperch) including Horsfall Beach, Bastendorff Beach and Cape Arago State Park, where anglers can find striped bass and surf perch. Please note, whenever surf fishing, consult tidal charts, weather conditions, and beware that sneaker waves occur on the Oregon Coast. **REMEMBER TO NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THE OCEAN.**

**CHARTER BOAT FISHING**

Thanks to the many charter boat companies in this area, fishermen of all levels can venture offshore for salmon, halibut, Albacore tuna and various bottom fish – from lingcod, to rockfish, to flatfish. [Charter boat operators](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tour-guides-and-charters/) can help plan half-day and full-day trips for any size group.
