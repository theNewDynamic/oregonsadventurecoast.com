Everyone loves a beautiful sunset, what’s not to love? There is something so humbling and inspiring about looking to the horizon and seeing the marvelous display of nature’s artwork with a variety of shades of pink, orange, blue, white and colors that don’t even have a name yet.

Every sunset is unique, but there is something especially remarkable about the sunsets here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston. We even have [a state park named after this natural phenomenon](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=70) we so frequently take for granted!

We see many lovely posts from visitors about the amazing sunsets they witnessed here and we’re fortunate to have an extraordinarily talented group of local photographers who have so beautifully captured the essence of the sunsets we’ve witnessed here in recent weeks. In fact, the images are so detailed, so extraordinary, that it feels almost like you are really here.

Words can never do justice to a beautiful sunset, so when you’re unable to travel to Oregon’s Adventure Coast, sunset photos are the next best thing. We know how much many of you are longing to come here in search of a magnificent sunset to watch fade into the Pacific and when you are ready to travel, we will be here to welcome you! In the meantime, here are some sunsets to help you imagine your next visit to Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston, our very own Oregon’s Adventure Coast.
