We understand that for many travelers, budgets can be tight. But that does not mean you can&#8217;t take a fun trip to the coast any time of the year! Some of the best destinations and activities on Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast can be experienced for a small amount and in many cases, absolutely FREE. Take the mighty Pacific Ocean for example. One could spend hours gazing at it&#8217;s dramatic beauty without spending a dime.

Here are some more free (or nearly free) ways to explore Oregon&#8217;s South Coast.
