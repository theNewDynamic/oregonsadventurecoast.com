Without question, summer is one of our favorite seasons on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**. While much of the West Coast is enduring record-breaking heat, we’re enjoying cool, comfortable temperatures that average in the mid-high 60s. Whether you plan to stay for a day, a weekend, a week or longer, you will find plenty of wonderful adventures to enjoy: water activities, hiking, world-class fishing, crabbing, clamming, ATVing, biking, Vegas-style gaming and more! Your adventure awaits.

Here are the top rated activities to enjoy this summer in Coos Bay/North Bend and Charleston (according to our visitors).

**#1 Go Fishing, Crabbing Or Clamming!**
Hands down, one of our favorite adventures that can be enjoyed any time of the year. Local tip: before you head out on your fishing adventure, contact our local bait and tackle shops and ask for tips! It could save you time and money! [Click here](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/fishing/) for more info.

**#2 Visit the Beaches and State Parks along the Cape Arago Highway Beach Loop.**
An Oregon's Adventure Coast trip is incomplete without at least one visit to the beaches and State Parks along the Cape Arago Highway Loop. The Cape Arago Beach Loop will take you to three state parks (Sunset Bay State Park, Shore Acres State Park, and Cape Arago State Park), in addition to breathtaking beaches and vantage points. Take a stroll and watch the surfers on Bastendorff Beach, or search for natural treasures in tide pools in the protected beach in Sunset Bay State Park. We recommend grabbing binoculars and taking some time to explore the Simpson Reef and nearby Shell Island to view and listen to the seals and sea lions. Shore Acres State Park, the crown jewel of Oregon's South Coast, is not to be missed. Take a scenic stroll along the breathtaking cliffs with majestic ocean views. Be sure to visit their famous gardens for a closer look at their stunning blooms.[ Download this guide](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/cape-arago-loop-itinerary-2018.pdf) to help you on your route.

**#3 Experience the Thrill of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.**
For a truly unique Oregon coast adventure, go for a ride or hike in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. This national treasure is the largest expanse of coastal sand dunes in North America; 40 miles in all. For guides, rentals and more,[ click here](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/untamed-dunes/).

The drive to the falls is part of the adventure, with winding roads that narrow in places and can take almost an hour to traverse.[ Click here](https://oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2016-02-05-adventure-spotlight-golden-and-silver-falls/) for our tips and more info.

**#8 Visit the Coos Bay Farmers Market**

**#9 Visit South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve.**
We can’t get enough of beautiful outdoor destinations, like [The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (South Slough NERR)](https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx), a 5,000-acre natural area located in the Coos estuary near Charleston. Not only are there miles of hiking trails and waterways to explore, but visitors can also enjoy an abundance of wildlife viewing.
