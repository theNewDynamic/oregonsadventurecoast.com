Plan your escape from the heat this summer, kick back, and enjoy some blissfully cool, comfortable temperatures that average in the mid-high 60s. Here are eight events and activities we're looking forward to this summer in Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston:

### **1) Visiting the Oregon State Parks**

![](/img/8-things-we-re-looking-forward-to-this-summer-in-coos-bay-north-bend-and-charleston-blog-695x322-10.jpg)

Most Oregonians know that one of the best ways to experience the beauty of our state is by exploring its[<u>state parks</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/). We love our state parks so much that the Oregon State Legislature established[<u>Oregon State Parks Day</u>](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=v.feature-article&amp;articleId=363) to thank Oregonians for their support and to celebrate these state treasures! **This year, State Parks Day will be celebrated on June 7, 2025, with free parking and events throughout the state!** June 7-8 is also a[<u>Free Fishing Weekend</u>](https://myodfw.com/articles/2024-free-fishing-days-and-events) in Oregon, so you won't need a license to fish, crab, or clam anywhere in the state!

That means on June 7, visitors won't have to pay to park at[<u>Shore Acres State Park</u>](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=68) (usually $10 per vehicle), the crown jewel of Oregon's South Coast, known for its dramatic cliffs, formal gardens, and panoramic ocean views. Nearby,[<u>Cape Arago State Park</u>](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=66) and[<u>Sunset Bay State Park</u>](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&amp;parkId=70) offer more opportunities to experience Oregon's rugged coastal beauty, from tidepools to scenic hiking trails. To make the most of your visit,[<u>download our Cape Arago Beach Loop PDF Guide</u>](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/img/cape-arago-loop-itinerary.pdf).

### **2) Visiting the Marshfield Sun Printing Museum**

Ever wonder why capital letters are called "upper case" and lowercase letters "lower case"? Or, where does the term "typing" originate from? You can learn the answers to these questions and more at [The Marshfield Sun Printing Museum](https://www.facebook.com/p/Marshfield-Sun-Printing-Museum-100071574391773/), a hidden gem located at the north end of Front Street on Coos Bay's historic waterfront.

Combine a visit to the *Marshfield Sun* with a visit to the nearby [Coos History Museum](https://cooshistory.org/) for an afternoon of fascinating local history.
