In recent years, many have learned that turning to nature is a wonderful way to stay grounded and healthy during challenging times. Some time ago, we received a letter from a group visiting from Medford, Oregon praising [Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trails](https://www.trailforks.com/region/whiskey-run-trails-21273/?activitytype=1&amp;z=12.4&amp;lat=43.21305&amp;lon=-124.36649), one of the prized biking trails in our region, so we thought this would be the perfect opportunity to spotlight this beloved destination.

This one-of-a-kind trail system flows and winds through the misty Coos County Forest on cross-country style trails for more than 30 miles.

The letter was written by Pastor Jim Wright from the Mountain Church in Medford, Oregon. Paster Wright leads an annual “Warriors” program, a group of adventure seekers that embark on various outdoor excursions in the Rogue Valley. The group embraces these adventures as an opportunity for growth and personal enrichment. Riding the Whiskey Run Mountain Bike Trails in the Coos County Forest was high on their list of adrenaline sports.

“The Whiskey Run MTB Trail system is a yet undiscovered gem of the Oregon Coast” says Pastor Wright. “Whomever it is that can be thanked for engineering and building such an epic system, please know, we are extremely grateful. The blood and sweat that has gone into the design and construction of this system has played a huge role not only in creating an epic destination for mountain bikers throughout the state and beyond, but more importantly, these trails have become a launch point to healthier marriages, families and communities in Southern Oregon.”

Whiskey Run is known among mountain biking enthusiasts for it’s moderate climbing and fun descending, that can be ridden all year long due to its loamy soil composition. Riders are treated to sweeping views of the Coos County Forest, tranquil streams, and fern covered forest floors that can only be experienced on Oregon’s South Coast.

The trail system is located about 10 minutes from Bandon or Coos Bay off Highway 101. Though the professionally built trails are made to withstand the coast’s weather, it is not recommended you ride if trails are muddy. Check trail reports or call the local shops or guide services for current conditions.
