***The Oregon Coast Public Art Trail Features Many Gems Located Right in Our Own Backyard!***

The unique setting on **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** has been a source of inspiration to artists and performers from all over the world so it didn’t surprise us when we saw that the [Oregon Coast Visitors Association](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/) decided to highlight public art on the Oregon Coast by creating a [Public Art Trail map](https://visittheoregoncoast.com/oregon-coast-public-art-trail/). People can easily access this map to take a self-guided tour along the entire coast, or sections of the coast, to learn about public art pieces along the way.

“The goal of this project is to help residents and visitors connect with artists, gain a deeper sense of place, and contribute in a meaningful way to artists’ livelihoods,” says OCVA Director, Marcus Hinz. “The public art trail is a perfect call to action for visitors venturing to the coast during the off-peak season.”
