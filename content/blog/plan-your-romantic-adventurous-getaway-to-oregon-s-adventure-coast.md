### Plan Your Romantic, Adventurous Getaway to Oregon’s Adventure Coast!

**Valentine’s Day 2020** falls on a long weekend, with Valentine’s Day on Friday and President’s Day on Monday. What better way to celebrate your love than with a weekend getaway to the beautiful Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area of the Oregon Coast?

If we are blessed with beautiful sunsets over the Valentine’s Weekend, there is no more romantic place to cuddle up with your honey than on the beach at **Sunset Bay State Park**. One of the most stunning locations to watch a sunset, this state park comes by its name honestly.

Enjoy a **romantic dinner for two** at one of the many [wonderful restaurants](/dining/) that call the Coos Bay Area home followed by a Spruce Tips IPA at [7 Devils Brewing Company](https://www.facebook.com/7DevilsBrewingCo/), Coos Bay’s homegrown craft brewery. Catch some live music around the fire pit at 7 Devils both Friday and Saturday night. Or head over to [The Mill Casino](https://www.themillcasino.com/) for some saucy music in Warehouse 101 and try your luck at the games.

During the day, [hiking](/hiking-walking/) along the rugged cliffs of the [Cape Arago Loop](/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/) between Sunset Bay and Shore Acres State Parks provides breathtaking views and [riding the dunes](/atv-motorsports/) in an ATV made for two will certainly get the adrenalin pumping.

And at the end of the day, stay in one of our fabulous lodging properties. These two hotels are even offering specials just for Valentine’s Day:

* [The Mill Casino * Hotel & RV Park](https://www.themillcasino.com/) is offering a Valentine’s Package including your room, a bottle of champagne, a chocolate treat from Coastal Mists, and a $50 dining credit to any of The Mill’s dining venues for $215 per night plus tax.
