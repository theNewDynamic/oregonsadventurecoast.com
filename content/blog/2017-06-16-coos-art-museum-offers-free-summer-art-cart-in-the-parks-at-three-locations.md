The mobile arts activity “Art Cart in the Parks” is designed to augment, enhance and expand the current Free Summer Lunch Program for children at Millicoma School, Boynton Park and John Topits Park.

Each program is designed to run for one hour and is completely free to all participants.

The Museum will be providing hands on art lessons that will be appropriate for all ages and are designed to keep kids active in learning and doing while school is out of session and boost the current free lunch program. For example, leaf and bark rubbings will provide a closer look at nature as well as a tactile experience and a lovely image they can take home.

The programs are made possible by a grant through the Autzen Foundation and with the additional support of Coos Bay Toyota. Since 1951, the Autzen Foundation has been supporting charitable work that makes Oregon a better place. Grants are awarded to social service, arts and culture, educational, and youth-centered organizations.

Coos Art Museum has been a cultural focal point of Oregon’s scenic Southern Coast since 1966. It occupies the historic 1936 Art Deco US Federal Building in downtown Coos Bay. The Museum offers a wide range of arts activities including exhibitions, art classes and lectures. Hours are 10:00am to 4:00pm, Tuesday through Friday and 1:00 to 4:00 pm on Saturday. Museum admission: $5 general, $2 students, veterans and seniors, free to Museum members.
