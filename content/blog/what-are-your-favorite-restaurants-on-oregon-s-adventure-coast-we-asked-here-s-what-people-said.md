Aside from the natural beauty, one of the things that visitors say they love the most about Oregon’s Adventure Coast is the food. We may have a charming small-town rustic vibe, but self-proclaimed “food-snobs” visiting from large cities all over the region have told us time and time again how impressed they are with the quality and the selection of the restaurants in our area. Hungry travelers can find world-class chowder, fresh local seafood, top-notch sushi, Thai, Italian, Mexican, and American comfort food within just a few miles of each other.

Not only will you fuel up for your big day on the coast, but dining in local establishments is also a great way to meet new people and get an authentic sense of the history and culture in our area. We recently asked some of the locals and frequent visitors to our area to share their favorite restaurant recommendations on Facebook, here’s what they said.
