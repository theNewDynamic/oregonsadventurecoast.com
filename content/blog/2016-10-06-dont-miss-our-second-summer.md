## Did you know that Fall is one of the BEST times to visit the Oregon Coast?

Autumn is so lovely that many of our locals refer to it as the Oregon Coast’s “Second Summer.” A few of the perks of traveling to the Oregon Coast during the fall season include:

#### Weather

During the autumn months, visitors can still find plenty of sunny days along with average highs in the upper 60’s and sometimes low 70’s.

#### Smaller Crowds

Since the crowds are usually smaller during this time, it’s a great time to do some early holiday shopping in our unique shops and antique stores. There is usually very little (if any) wait time to get a table in your favorite restaurant, and visitors often find the beaches almost to themselves at times!

#### Great Hotel Deals

Since lodging prices tend to drop after Labor Day Weekend, why not take advantage? <a href="/deals/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to find some of the best deals.

Inspired to give it a try? We’ve put together a list of some of our most popular activities to help you plan your “Second Summer Getaway”.

#### Explore our Beaches

We have the most [diverse options](/featured-adventures/undeveloped-beaches/ "beaches") on the Oregon Coast. Go beachcombing, picnicking, or tidepooling. Some of our favorite local beaches include [Bastendorff Beach](/listings/bastendorff-beach/ "Bastendorff Beach"), [Cape Arago State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=66 "cape arago state park"), [Lighthouse Beach](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2017-07-19-how-to-find-an-epic-view-of-the-cape-arago-lighthouse/ "Lighthouse Beach"), [Horsfall Beach](https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110612&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&recid=42625&ttype=recarea&pname=Horsfall%20Beach%20Campground "Horsfall Beach"), [Shore Acres State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=68 "shore acres state park") & Simpson Beach, and of course [Sunset Bay State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=70 "Sunset bay state park").

#### Discover our Roots

With a rich background in timber and fishing, there’s lots of history to explore. A favorite is always [Cape Arago Lighthouse](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2017-07-19-how-to-find-an-epic-view-of-the-cape-arago-lighthouse/ "cape arago lighthouse") and [Self Guided Historic Walking Tours](/featured-adventures/history-culture/ "historic information"). Be sure to take a stroll along the Coos Bay Boardwalk in Downtown Coos Bay and explore our rich maritime history at the newly opened <a href="http://cooshistory.org/" target="_blank">Coos History Museum & Maritime Collection</a> on N. Front St.

#### Hiking & Biking Trails

Dozens of [hiking and biking trails](/featured-adventures/walking-hiking/ "hiking and biking trails") will take you through the forest, mountains and cities or along rivers and coast. Favorites include the [Oregon Coast Trail](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/tripideas/explore-the-cape-arago-beach-loop/ "Oregon Coast Trail") (Sunset Bay to Cape Arago), four miles of trails winding along one of the most spectacular coastlines in Oregon.

Adventure seekers also enjoy exploring the [Bluebill Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/bluebill-lake-trail "bluebill trail"). Located off Horsfall Road in the Oregon National Recreation Area, this trail loops around a seasonal lake which is home to different species of birds and aquatic animals. Bring your camera and binoculars to view the sights.

We should also note a trip to the <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/south-slough-national-estuary/" target="_blank">South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve</a> is always a treat. This local gem offers outdoor lovers 9,000 acres and offers hiking trails for all ability levels.

#### Fishing and Crabbing

If it’s a fishing adventure you’re after, you’ll be happy to know that there are over 30 lakes and rivers to choose from in Coos County. There’s fish for every season and an endless choice of prime fishing spots to select from.

No trip to the Adventure Coast is complete without Dungeness crab, and the best crab are always the ones you bring up yourself from the waters of lower Coos Bay. Our local fishing expert, Gary Vonderohe from the <a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/" target="_blank">Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife</a> says that crabbing has been very good the past couple of weeks and should continue to get better. “This is the best crabbing I’ve seen in several years,” he says.
