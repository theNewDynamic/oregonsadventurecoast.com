There is much to love about visiting Oregon's Adventure Coast, but the miles and miles of beautiful, undeveloped beaches may be one of our greatest natural assets. The beaches on Oregon's South Coast are ideal for anyone searching for a quiet, undisturbed spot to watch the tide roll in and out. They are also perfect for those looking for a place to surf, swim, walk the dogs or search for hidden beach treasures.

If beach-combing, tide-pooling, picnicking, whale watching, surfing and clamming or other popular pastimes are on your Oregon Coast wish list, look no further than our very own beaches and be sure to follow these tips to stay safe & protect our natural habitat. Visitors going to the beach should be aware of coastal safety hazards with the potential danger of undertows, sneaker waves and rolling logs.

### **Beach-Combing & Tide-Pooling Tips**

Consider these tips below to stay safe and make the most of your coastline expeditions.

### **1\.&nbsp; Check the Tides Charts**

When beach-combing and tide-pooling it’s crucial to make sure the tide is out during the time you’ll be on the beach. Visit \[www.tides4fishing.com\](https://tides4fishing.com/us/oregon/coos-bay and/) and/or [www.tideschart.com](https://www.tideschart.com/United-States/Oregon/Coos-Bay) for an easy-to-use tide chart for the Coos Bay area.

### **2\.&nbsp; Wear&nbsp;Shoes/Boots with Grip**

Just because it’s the beach does not mean there will be any shortage of sharp surfaces and potentially harmful objects. Bring shoes with grip to ensure you’ll keep your footing as you make your way down paths to the beach and to keep your feet safe.

### **3\. &nbsp;Watch Where You Step**

This tip goes hand in hand with the previous one. When the tide goes out it’s likely to leave behind slick,&nbsp;**slick** seaweed. Stepping on it can result in a vicious fall and potential serious injury. Tread heavy and carefully.

### **4\.&nbsp; Do Not Remove Attached Animals**

Though the temptation may be to grab a critter you see, keep in mind that doing so can bring damage to the organism and even ecosystem as a whole.

### **5\. &nbsp;Don’t Leave&nbsp;Rocks Overturned**

Similarly, rocks provide a crucial part of the ecosystem of many of the organisms you’ll see when tide-pooling. By leaving rocks overturned you can negatively influence the ecosystem and disrupt different species.

### **6\. Leave it Better Than You Found it**

This one is a good rule in general but goes double when you are visiting the beaches. Bring a bag with you to pick up after your own trash and if you’re so inclined to pick up any stray pieces of garbage you come across. Not only are you doing your part to help the environment but you’re also beautifying the area for other visitors.

### 7\. Bring a Camera

You’ll be seeing some beautiful sights along these beach spots, we strongly recommend taking some pictures as you do so.

**Lighthouse Beach**\- Located between Yoakam Point State Natural Site to the south and Cape Arago Lighthouse to the north. The beach is popular with surfers, kayakers, and birdwatchers and offers slight protection from cross currents and wind due to the rocky headlands framing the beach. Since the beach does not have a parking lot, most visitors park along the Cape Arago Highway, near the intersection of Lighthouse Way, and walk down a path to the beach. The beach can also be accessed via kayak, launching from Sunset Bay State Park or Bastendorff Beach County Park.[Click here](https://www.google.com/search?q=coos%20bay%20Lighthouse%20Beach&amp;rlz=1CAPHYB_enUS827&amp;oq=coos+bay+Lighthouse+Beach&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j69i64.5223j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;npsic=0&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=0&amp;rllag=43339874,-124371744,329&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;rldimm=14631497226017939902&amp;phdesc=XWNf8THaiFs&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVjM-j9evhAhVJTt8KHd-fA48QvS4wAHoECAkQCQ&amp;rldoc=1&amp;tbs=lrf:!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:1&amp;rlst=f)for more info.
