The Coos Art Museum (CAM), one of our favorite cultural gems on Oregon&#8217;s Coast, is turning 50 this year! To celebrate this milestone, the Museum invites you to participate in the 2016 Arts & Culture Rally & Charm Trail happening now through December 31, 2016.

<a href="http://www.coosart.org/2016-arts-culture-rally-charm-trail/" target="_blank">The Arts & Culture Rally & Charm Trail</a> is a fun adventure that takes you through seven communities along the south coast and 51 local venues that showcase Arts & Culture. Participants can find a one-of-a-kind souvenir while experiencing the growing local arts and cultural scene on the southern Oregon coast.

&#8220;From museums to little cultural sites to little boutique shops that feature local arts and culture &#8230; so that you really get to know the Oregon coast and what makes it special,&#8221; says Debbie Will with Coos Art Museum in <a href="http://kcby.com/news/local/coos-art-museum-celebrates-50-years-with-arts-culture-rally-charm-trail" target="_blank">this KCBY article</a>.

Coos Art Museum has been a cultural focal point of Oregon’s scenic Southern Coast since 1966. It occupies an historic 1936 Art Deco US Federal Building in downtown Coos Bay.

The Museum offers a wide range of arts activities including traveling and permanent exhibitions, art classes and lectures. One of their current exhibits, <a href="http://www.coosart.org/expressions-west-2016/" target="_blank">Expressions West 2016</a>, features sixty-one recent paintings by fifty-four artists residing in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington.
