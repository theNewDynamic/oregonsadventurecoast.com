**_“Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty.” - John Ruskin_**

Earth Day is this week (April 22nd), so we thought this would be a good time to reflect on the abundance of beauty and natural resources that can be found right here on **Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston**. In honor of Earth Day, we’ve put together a list of some of our favorite ways to celebrate the earth and its many treasures on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

We all want to be good stewards of the ocean and waterways, the forests, and the land we are so fortunate to have access to and we hope you find these eco-friendly activities as inspiring as we do:

 1. [Go tidepooling](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/where-how-to-explore-the-amazing-tide-pools-on-oregon-s-adventure-coast/) and discover a new species or natural treasure. Look but don’t touch!
 2. Explore a “secret beach” and a secluded ocean cove on Simpson Beach, just below [Shore Acres State Park](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/state-parks-and-national-lands/).
 3. Hike through lush coastal forests to [Golden and Silver Falls State Natural Area](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/2016-02-05-adventure-spotlight-golden-and-silver-falls/), two magnificent waterfalls here on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.
 4. Check out organizations dedicated to sustainability like the [Washed Ashore Project](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/the-washed-ashore-project-coming-to-coos-bay/) and the [Charleston Marine Life Center](https://cmlc.uoregon.edu/).
 5. Spend a day birdwatching, hiking beautiful trails and/or kayaking miles of protected waterways at the[ South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/blog/ten-things-people-love-about-slough-national-estuarine-research-reserve/).
