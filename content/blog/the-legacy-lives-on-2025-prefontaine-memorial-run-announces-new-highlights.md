### “To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.” - Steve Prefontaine

There are numerous reasons why **Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston** is a popular destination with runners and track and field fans. Yes, natural running trails are abundant, yes, the scenery is spectacular and unlike anything you'll see anywhere else in the country, and yes, we have several [well-organized races](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/running/) that runners want to participate in each year.

However, Coos Bay may be best known as the hometown of internationally acclaimed distance runner [Steve Prefontaine](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/steve-prefontaine-story/), the athlete who helped inspire the running movement that is still gaining traction and growing in popularity to this day. Our small town is where "Pre" honed his skills and discovered his fierce competitiveness and determination that would soon captivate fans all over the world.

We are proud to host visitors who have traveled from far and wide each year to Oregon's Adventure Coast to participate in the [Prefontaine Memorial Run](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-prefontaine-memorial-run/), part of the annual [Bay Area Fun Festival](https://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/event/annual-bay-area-fun-festival/). The yearly memorial run is a challenging 10K road race across one of his former training courses with its finish line at the high school track where he first competed. "At no place is the celebration of Steve Prefontaine and his story more personal than in Coos Bay, Oregon, where he was born in 1951 and discovered his gift for running fast and far as a student at Marshfield High School," say event organizers. "Here, he developed his hunger to be the best in the field, and more, to do it with style—to create beauty when he ran, to show people something they had never seen before."

### About Steve Prefontaine

![Steve Prefontaine](/img/preformal-portrait.jpg "Steve Prefontaine")

Steve Prefontaine was born and raised in Coos Bay, Oregon, and graduated from [Marshfield High School](http://marshfield.cbd9.net/). When he enrolled at the [University of Oregon](http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=30594) in 1969, he was already one of the most highly sought-after high school track athletes in the school's history. Steve's sister, Linda Prefontaine, recalls her brother's competitiveness.“It was great to watch him compete,” she says. “I was a very proud sister. He was exciting and entertaining to watch. He made people, from all walks of life, want to watch him. He made the sport exciting.” You can hear Linda speak of her brother in her own words in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nuPfMf8vQY).

Steve went on to compete in international meets against the USSR, Germany, Great Britain, and a combined European team. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated as "America's Distance Prodigy". Eventually, he helped to popularize the new Nike brand in the 1970s through his partnership with co-founder and former coach Bill Bowerman. “Pre was a rebel from a working-class background, a guy full of cockiness and guts,” says Nike co-founder Phil Knight. “Pre’s spirit is the cornerstone of this company’s soul.”

His life was tragically cut short in a car accident at the age of 24 on May 30, 1975, in Eugene, Oregon. At the time of his death, Pre held every American distance running record from 2 miles through 10,000 meters.

Nike recently featured Steve Prefontaine in a <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/stories/how-steve-prefontaine-set-the-pace-for-nike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special profile</a> on the 50th anniversary of his death:

> His legacy is multifaceted. To generations of athletes at all levels, he embodies the philosophy of training incredibly hard and going all out in competition. For Nike, he was both a muse on the track and a trailblazer who pioneered a highly original and personal way of inspiring athletes with the brand. For fellow runners hamstrung by the AAU, Prefontaine was a leader who helped turn the tide towards professionalism.
