  Marty Giles and Wavecrest Discoveries specialize in "mind-refreshing"
  nature-based tours and activities that reconnect you with nature on the
  southern Oregon Coast.  Our experienced, knowledgeable staff can focus on the
  details of the dunes, beaches, tidepools, forest, or waterways—or give you a
  wholistic tour of this delightful area. Over the years, Wavecrest has
  developed an exciting array of activities to introduce you to the diverse
  nature, history, and culture of Coos County and the Southern Oregon Coast.
  Short walks, half-, or full-day excursions are available, as well as general
  community/area orientation, or specialized options that can include
  explorations of the dunes, sandy or rocky beaches (including clamming and
  tidepooling), forests, wetlands, and much more.
