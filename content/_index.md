We welcome you to Oregon’s Adventure Coast, where the land meets the bay and the sea, opening up an abundance of possibilities. We invite you to explore, to discover, to feel, to know…at land’s end, adventure begins. On Oregon’s Adventure Coast, you will find not just something to do, but something you want to do. Your vacation will be full of adventure, nature, wildlife, culture, arts and athletics.

## Exciting Outdoor Activities on the Oregon Coast

Water and outdoor activities abound on the Oregon Coast, from kayaking, scuba diving and surfing to world-class fishing, crabbing and clamming. Hit the sand in an ATV, hike winding trails, bike along the boardwalk, and run the same path as legend and local hero, Steve Prefontaine. Take a chance with Vegas-style gaming, catch a movie at the historic Egyptian Theatre, and make time to dine upon a hilltop. Your adventure awaits.
