About Public Meetings

A "Public Meeting" is a convening of a quorum of the governing body of public body for the purpose of deciding or deliberating upon issues. Without a quorum, the meeting is not a public meeting and the open meetings law does not apply.

Public Meetings Law is not a "public participation law." The right of the public to attend meetings does not include the right to participate by giving testimony or comment.

The presiding office has the inherent authority to keep order and impost reasonable restrictions necessary for the orderly and efficient conduct of the meeting. Unless the board decides otherwise, the presiding officer may regulate or disallow public input, may limit public input to relevant points, and may establish time limits for such input.
