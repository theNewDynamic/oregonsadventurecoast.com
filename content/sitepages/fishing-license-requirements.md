According to Oregon fishing regulations, an Oregon fishing license is required for everyone 12 years or older except during the state’s free fishing weekends when licenses or tags are NOT required. (The Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife holds multiple free fishing weekends each year. Check [the ODFW site](https://myodfw.com/fishing) for information.) Daily, multi-day and annual licenses are available at sporting goods stores and other local retailers. **Find a list of vendors** [**here**](https://myodfw.com/articles/where-find-odfw-license-agentsvendors) **or** [**purchase online**](https://odfw.huntfishoregon.com/login) **from ODFW.**
