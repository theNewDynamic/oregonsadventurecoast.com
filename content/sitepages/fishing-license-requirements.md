According to Oregon fishing regulations, an Oregon fishing license is required for everyone 12 years or older except during the stateâ€™s free fishing weekends when licenses or tags are NOT required. (The Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife holds multiple free fishing weekends each year. Check [the ODFW site](https://myodfw.com/fishing) for information.) Daily, multi-day and annual licenses are available at sporting goods stores and other local retailers. **Find a list of vendors** [**here**](https://myodfw.com/articles/where-find-odfw-license-agentsvendors) **or** [**purchase online**](https://odfw.huntfishoregon.com/login) **from ODFW.**
