### HISTORY

{{< floatimage src="/img/canoe-races-history.jpg" float="right" alt="Canoe Races are Recreated at the Salmon Celebration" >}}

Nature, commerce, native traditions and pioneer spirit merge together to create an oasis of adventure on the Oregon Coast. First settled thousands of years ago, native tribes found abundant food and a temperate climate. These tribes continued to inhabit the region when exploration and trapping in the area began in the early 1800’s. And in 1853, a permanent settlement was established by members of the Coos Bay Company.

Wagon roads first connected Coos Bay to Jacksonville and Roseburg, in the 1850’s. The Port of Coos Bay, which may be the best natural harbor between San Francisco Bay and the Puget Sound, is the world’s largest forest products shipping port. Gold drew people in the 1800’s. Many coal mines operated between 1890-1910; the last mine closed in 1950.

Today, forest products, tourism, fishing and agriculture dominate the economy. Boating, dairy farming, myrtlewood production, shipbuilding and specialty farm products like cranberries, play a key role.
