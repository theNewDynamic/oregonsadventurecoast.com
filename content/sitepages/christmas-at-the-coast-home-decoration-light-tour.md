#### Online sign up to be on the map is now closed, but we invite you to still decorate your house or business and light up the Coast this Holiday Season.

{{< spacer 20 >}}

**We invite our neighbors in Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston, and communities around the Bay Area to participate in the First Christmas on the Coast! Event will run Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve.**

With no Holiday Lights at Shore Acres in 2020, a few community leaders and our Facebook friends decided to create an opportunity for our community to show our Holiday Spirit! Decorate your home or business, let us know the address, we'll work on getting the word out to encourage residents and visitors to tour the area looking at all the beautiful lights. Join our [Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/ChristmasattheCoast/) for updates!
