The Coos Bay- North Bend Visitors and Convention Bureau (VCB) would like to make a statement regarding a recent photograph of an appalling racial slur against our black community painted on a fence in Coos Bay just days ago. The racial slur that was used is utterly offensive and has understandably caused a great deal of outrage by members of our community and beyond who have shared the photograph on social media. This incident, combined with the national outcry over inequality has prompted us to send a very clear message to our tourists and local residents.

**The Coos Bay-North Bend Visitors and Convention Bureau (VCB) unequivocally denounces this appalling act and the racist sentiment behind it. This photograph does not in any way represent our values or who we are as a community.**

We, too, were shocked and horrified that this could happen here. It is a stark reminder that no community is immune to racism and bigotry and we must acknowledge that and address it in order to move forward. Seeing this photograph is a wake-up call to us and to our leaders that it is not enough to simply not be racist, we must be anti-racist and will speak up and take swift action when confronted with reprehensible actions such as this. This act was on private property and was offensive and unacceptable. We are grateful to the property owner and neighbors for acting as quickly as possible to remove the statement.

We would like to thank the members of our community who have taken it upon themselves to address this incident and call it out for what it is - a clear and horrific attack of words on people of color who visit and live in this community. To these residents and visitors, we want you to know that we hear you, we stand by you, and we welcome you here. Racism has no place on Oregon’s Adventure Coast.

Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston, collectively known as Oregon’s Adventure Coast, takes a tremendous amount of pride in our beautiful region, and we want everyone to feel welcome.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of the VCB
