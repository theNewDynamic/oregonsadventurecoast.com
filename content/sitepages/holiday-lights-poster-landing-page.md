#### Time-Specific Parking Pass

If you’re planning to drive, you will need a special&nbsp;**<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/tourParkDetail.do?contractCode=OR&amp;parkId=402381">Time-Specific Parking Pass</a>**&nbsp;in advance again this year. In an effort to reduce wait times and backed up traffic conditions, you’ll be required to make a&nbsp;**Parking Pass reservation**&nbsp;to visit. These Parking Passes are&nbsp;**per vehicle, not per person**. The passes are only $5 per vehicle, unless you already have an annual park pass&nbsp;*(see Important Park Pass Information below)*.&nbsp;***Either way, advance online reservation is required.***&nbsp;Parking Passes are managed by the **<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/tourParkDetail.do?contractCode=OR&amp;parkId=402381"><strong>Oregon State Parks</a>**.

**Click the “Book Parking Pass Now” button below to secure your time-specific parking reservation. Don’t forget to print your pass or catch a screen shot of your pass. You will need the printed or screen shot pass to enter the park. Have questions? Call (541) 888-3778, the local State Parks office.**<br>

**Entry into the lights is always Free, but you must pay the $5 parking fee per vehicle to park at Shore Acres for the Event - in advance this year.**

1. **Pick your day/time to visit** - note that half of the parking tickets will be sold in advance with the rest available within 7 days of entry
2. [**Visit the OPRD website**](https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/tourParkDetail.do?contractCode=OR&amp;parkId=402381) **or click the Book Now Button below to book your time**
3. **Pay the $5 fee** per vehicle

**Important Park Pass Information:** If you have an annual park pass (12- or 24-month), the Oregon Pacific Coast Passport, a current OR State Park camping confirmation that coincides with the date of event visit, or a special access pass (see website above for more info), the $5 will be waived. **You still have to book online. You will need to present your event parking pass AND your special pass at the gate.**
