## New Ticketed Timed Entry This Year!

{{< spacer 15 >}}

This year, [**Holiday Lights visitation will be through a timed reservation system**](https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/tourParkDetail.do?contractCode=OR&parkId=402381). This is an effort to decrease long wait times and backed-up traffic conditions.

**Entry into the lights is Free, but you must pay the $5 parking fee per vehicle to park at Shore Acres for the Event - in advance this year.**

**Hereâ€™s how to do it!**

1. **Pick your day/time to visit** - note that half of the parking tickets will be sold in advance with the rest available within 7 days of entry
2. [**Visit the OPRD website**](https://oregonstateparks.reserveamerica.com/tourParkDetail.do?contractCode=OR&parkId=402381) **or click the Book Now Button below to book your time**
3. **Pay the $5 fee** per vehicle
4. **Print your pass** - you must bring the pass with you to enter the park
