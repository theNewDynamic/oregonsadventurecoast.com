### GETTING HERE

**Directions from North I-5** I-5 South to exit 162. Merge onto Hwy 38/Hwy 99 toward Drain/Elkton. Take Hwy 38 to Hwy 101 in Reedsport. Turn south on Hwy 101 and go approximately 26 miles.

**Directions from South 1-5** I-5 North. Take exit 119 toward Hwy 99S/Winston/Hwy 42W/Coos Bay. Merge onto Coos Bay-Roseburg Hwy. Take a slight left at Maryland Ave then continue on 8th St/Coos Bay-Roseburg Hwy/ Hwy 42. Turn north on Hwy 101 and go approximately 5 miles.

**Flying Here (Airport Code OTH)** Your gateway to Adventure begins at Southwest Oregon Regional Airport. We boast the only commercial airport on the Oregon Coast with daily, non-stop flights to and from San Francisco and seasonal non-stop flights to Denver. Serviced by United Express, for ticket information, please visit [www.united.com](http://www.united.com).

### RULES OF THE ROAD

There’s a few things you need to know about driving in Oregon:

**Hands Free –** That means only hands free mobile devices are allowed to be in use while driving.

**Gas Stations –** In Oregon we pump your gas! So please sit back and relax and let one of our gas station attendants take care of you. Don’t be shy about asking for your windshield cleaned, we’re happy to serve you. Tipping is not required as this service is part of Oregon Law.

**Speed Limits –** Along most of the coastal portions of the Oregon coast, the speed limit ranges from 50 – 55 mph. Please be sure to follow the posted signs and give yourself a little extra time, we’d hate for a speeding ticket to taint your road trip. When approaching windy areas or towns along highway 101, be prepared to reduce your speed. The coastal route is so beautiful you won’t mind slowing down.

### WEATHER

**The Climate -** Coos County has a temperate, mild marine climate. We are spoiled because we don’t experience the dramatic highs and lows of the inland sections of the state. Temperatures range from annual mean highs of 59.5 to annual mean lows of 45.5 degrees. Oregon’s Adventure Coast has elevation from zero to 400 feet above sea level. We get a pleasant 63.48 inches average per-year rainfall along the coast. This keeps the lush greenery alive and helps maintain our agricultural industry. Almost half of our rain falls in November, December and January.

**What to Wear -** While our area is temperate year round, there are seasonal fluctuations and daily ranges. Be sure to check the local, extended forecast. We encourage you to bring hiking boots if you plan to explore. A light, waterproof jacket and sweaters help with the evening breezes, and depending on the season, a combination of shorts and long pants will give you some options for daytime adventures.

Oregon’s Adventure Coast is a fairly casual area, so unless you are attending a specific formal event, casual dress will be welcomed most anywhere. While jeans are not always appropriate, khakis or Dockers fill the void. Pack smart and you won’t have any trouble at all.

### TRAVELING WITH PETS

Of course you want to bring your best, four legged friend on your trip. After all, they are part of the family.

There are a few things to keep in mind when bringing Fido along. Make sure you always keep your pet on a leash when in public areas. Oregon’s Adventure Coast has plenty of pet lodging options, services and play areas.

**Two local favorite locations** of pet owners are Horsfall Beach in North Bend and Bastendorff Beach in Charleston. Both have long stretches of beach for them to run and play. Dogs are allowed off leash provided they are well behaved and must be under owner’s control at all time.

And for the adventures that you can’t bring your pet along, we have plenty of pet sitting services who can help out! Please keep in mind you should check in advance with care providers to see what pet records are required.

### SAFETY

We want to make sure that you’re safe and sound while visiting, so here are a few tips to remember:

* While our oceans are beautiful and there for your enjoyment, please remember to respect the power of the ocean.
* **Never turn your back on the ocean.**
* Be careful of sneaker waves, they carry a dangerous undertow and as the name reflects, can sneak up on you.
* There are no lifeguards on our beaches.
* Be wary, especially in winter months and utilize storm watching sites during inclement weather.
* The safest areas to view winter storms are at the storm watching hut at Shore Acres State Park, the bluff overlooking Bastendorff Beach, and Sunset Bay State Park.

### Tsunamis

While traveling on the coast, you’ll notice signs pointing to Tsunami safe zones. Tsunamis are rare, but it is still important to be up-to-speed on safety information and know what to do. Click here for a list of tips and safe zones. Our area is equipped with a tsunami warning system so you’ll hear a series of loud warning sirens letting you know when it’s time to get to higher ground.

### Medical Facilites

We have the largest hospital on the Oregon Coast. While we hope you will not need to use our medical facilities while visiting, if you do, rest assured that you’ll be well taken care of.
