## Local Industry Resources

The **Coos Bay-North Bend Visitor & Convention Bureau (VCB)** and the Coos Bay Visitor Information Center provide the following documents to our local industry partners to assist in planning and requests.

**Regular Monthly Meeting of the VCB Board of Directors**  
The 2nd Thursday of every month is slated for the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Coos Bay-North Bend Visitor & Convention. To receive an agenda, RSVP to attend in person and/or receive the Zoom link to attend virtually, please contact Janice Langlinais at [janice@oregonsadventurecoast.com](mail:janice@oregonsadventurecoast.com). 

**Reader Board Policies**

**Requests for VCB Grant Funds**  
The VCB has very limited funds available for first time events and initial costs of a new project or program. These funds are based on the available budget the VCB is allotted based on Lodging Tax collections. A maximum of $3,000 can be awarded and an application process is required.
