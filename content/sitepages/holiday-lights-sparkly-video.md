## Dazzling Holiday Lights at Shore Acres State Park!

Holiday Lights are set to sparkle again on **Oregon's Adventure Coast** this season at Shore Acres State Park. Perched on the rugged cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Shore Acres State Park is famous for its beautiful 7-acre botanical gardens and Japanese lily pond. Visitors get a chance to stroll through this holiday tradition **every night from 4:30pm to 9:00pm, Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve** â€“ including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. It has become a real holiday tradition for the whole family. **Admission is always free! However, parking at Shore Acres any time of the year is $5.**
