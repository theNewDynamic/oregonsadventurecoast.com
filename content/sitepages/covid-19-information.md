**_Updated June 30, 2021_**

#### **On June 30, 2021, Governor Brown has lifted the state mask and 6 foot distancing mandates,** (with certain exceptions, including health care, public transit, and airports)**.** 

Note that some businesses may require their employees to continue to wear masks.

Bars may now stay open until 2pm if the establishment decides to do so. Businesses may also remove the plexiglass barriers put in place when distancing was not possible.
