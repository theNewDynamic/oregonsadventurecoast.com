**As the developments in Coronavirus (COVID-19) continue to unfold, please follow the direction from our public health authorities including the** [**CDC**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)**,** [**Oregon Health Authority**](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/pages/index.aspx)**, and** [**Coos Health & Wellness**](https://cooshealthandwellness.org/) **to protect our community and visitors.**

In these uncertain times, we want our residents and visitors to know that Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston are open for business and welcomes visitors. **Our attractions, restaurants, and accommodations are taking additional measures to ensure a clean, safe experience for our visitors.** Our tourism industry is feeling the impact of this pandemic with cancellations of events and room nights. We encourage visitors and locals to enjoy our amenities, but also continue to take safety measures while doing so.

* Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
* Cover nose and mouth using bent elbow or a tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
* Practice social distancing of 3 feet when in small crowds.

We are closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as it relates to our state, our county and our destinations. **At this time, we have no confirmed cases in Coos County.** 

**Our top priority is the safety, health, and well-being of our community, its residents, and visitors.** Federal public health officials have repeated frequently that it is safe for healthy people to travel in the U.S. We encourage the traveling public to seek and heed the latest expert guidance, and to make fact-based travel decisions.

This is a rapidly evolving situation that changes by the hour and there is a lot of uncertainty. We strongly encourage residents and travelers to always follow public health authoritiesâ€™ recommendations above all else.
