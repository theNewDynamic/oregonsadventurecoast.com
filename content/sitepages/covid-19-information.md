establishments to open to 25% capacity (or 50 people, whichever is smaller). It also allows outdoor dining (75 people maximum, including individual dining pods) and retail stores and shopping malls to open to a maximum of 50% occupancy.

**Face coverings** are still mandatory for all when inside a public space and when outdoors when 6 feet distancing cannot be maintained.
