This means some restaurants are now open for dine-in with restrictions and retail businesses are now able to re-open with certain protocols. Please be mindful of others when out in public. We encourage you to wear a mask when in public and to keep a 6 foot distance from others whenever possible. **Please call ahead before going to a shop or restaurant to ensure the business is open!**

**Visitor Information Centers in Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston are all open to assist you when visiting our area. Please follow the protocols in place at each Center.**

**If you are ready to travel, we are ready to welcome you back to Oregon's Adventure Coast. However, if you are feeling ill or not comfortable traveling right now, we encourage to stay home and stay healthy. Let's all do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19.**

Here are some suggestions to help you stay healthy.

* Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
* Cover nose and mouth using bent elbow or a tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
* Practice social distancing of 6 feet when in small crowds.
* STAY HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

We are closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as it relates to our state, our county and our destinations. **At this time, we have 30 confirmed cases, and two presumptive cases, in Coos County, a majority of those cases were associated with Shutter Creek Correctional Institution and have all been resolved.**

This situation continues to evolve with changes daily and there is a lot of uncertainty. We strongly encourage residents and travelers to always follow public health authoritiesâ€™ recommendations above all else.

**When you are ready to travel, we are ready to welcome you back where we have Adventures to Invigorate and Space to Spread Out!**
