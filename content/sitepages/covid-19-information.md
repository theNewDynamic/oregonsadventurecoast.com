Our tourism industry is feeling the impact of this pandemic with cancellations of events and room nights. We encourage visitors and locals to STAY HOME & STAY HEALTHY. We will be happy to welcome you when all of this is over and we are able to travel again.

In the meantime, here are some suggestions to help you stay healthy.

* Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
* Cover nose and mouth using bent elbow or a tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
* Practice social distancing of 6 feet when in small crowds.
* **STAY HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID-19**

We are closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as it relates to our state, our county and our destinations. **At this time, we have no confirmed cases in Coos County. County Commissioner Melissa Cribbins updates this data daily on her** [**Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/commissionercribbins/)**.**

This is a rapidly evolving situation that changes by the hour and there is a lot of uncertainty. We strongly encourage residents and travelers to always follow public health authoritiesâ€™ recommendations above all else.

**We look forward to seeing you in the future.**
