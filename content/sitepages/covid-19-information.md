**As the developments in Coronavirus (COVID-19) continue to unfold, please follow the direction from our public health authorities including the** [**CDC**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)**,** [**Oregon Health Authority**](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/pages/index.aspx)**, and** [**Coos Health & Wellness**](https://cooshealthandwellness.org/) **to protect yourself, our community and our visitors.**

**Due to the Governor's Stay at Home order of March 23, 2020 all non-essential businesses, attractions, state parks, county parks, recreation providers, pools, and shopping malls are closed until further notice. The Governor is strongly discouraging non-essential travel in the state and WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO STAY HOME & STAY HEALTHY. Let's all do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19.**

**Our attractions, restaurants, and accommodations are taking additional measures to ensure a clean, safe experience.** Our tourism industry is feeling the impact of this pandemic with cancellations of events and room nights. We encourage visitors and locals to enjoy our amenities, but also continue to take safety measures while doing so.

* Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
* Cover nose and mouth using bent elbow or a tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
* Practice social distancing of 3 feet when in small crowds.

We are closely monitoring the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic as it relates to our state, our county and our destinations. **At this time, we have no confirmed cases in Coos County. County Commissioner Melissa Cribbins updates this data daily on her** [**Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/commissionercribbins/)**.**

**Our top priority is the safety, health, and well-being of our community, its residents, and visitors.** Federal public health officials have repeated frequently that it is safe for healthy people to travel in the U.S. We encourage the traveling public to seek and heed the latest expert guidance, and to make fact-based travel decisions.

This is a rapidly evolving situation that changes by the hour and there is a lot of uncertainty. We strongly encourage residents and travelers to always follow public health authoritiesâ€™ recommendations above all else.

**If you choose to travel, we welcome you. If you choose to stay home at this time, we look forward to seeing you in the future.**
