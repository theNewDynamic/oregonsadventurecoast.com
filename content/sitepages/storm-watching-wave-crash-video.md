## The Best Oregon Coast Storm Watching is at Shore Acres!

Near Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston, experience the dramatic power of the Pacific as turbulent seas collide with 80-foot cliffs, sending waves crashing up to 300 feet highâ€”all from the safety of the park's Storm Watching Hut. The best time to witness these awe-inspiring displays is during the fall and winter months, from November through March, when Pacific storms are at their peak.

As Oregon Coast experts, we can assure you that no matter how many times you've seen Mother Nature's raw power, every storm offers a unique and unforgettable experience.
