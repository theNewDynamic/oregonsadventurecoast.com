_Please know that we are doing our best to keep up with the restaurants offering NEW Dine-in service, take-out, curbside pickup and delivery, but please call the restaurant before heading out to ensure they are open for business at the time you desire a meal. Thank you!_

#### Coos County has entered Phase II and area restaurants have been allowed to re-open for dining as long as they can meet the new guidelines. We will try to note which restaurants are open for dine-in here, but encourage you to CALL before you go!
