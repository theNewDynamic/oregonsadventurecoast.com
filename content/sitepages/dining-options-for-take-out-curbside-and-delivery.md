**_Updated 5:00pm PST, March 19, 2020_**

Due to the directive by Governor Kate Brown on March 16, 2020 for all restaurants and bars to close seated dining services and instead offer Take-Out, Curbside, or Delivery services, we have compiled a list of Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston restaurants, coffee shops, and bars offering these services. This list will be updated as establishments alert us of their plans.

**_PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THESE ESTABLISHMENTS CANNOT SERVE YOU ANYWHERE ON THEIR PREMISES - DECKS, PATIOS, PARKING LOTS - THEY CAN ONLY SERVE TO GO ORDERS TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE BUSINESS TO BE CONSUMED. - OLCC_**
