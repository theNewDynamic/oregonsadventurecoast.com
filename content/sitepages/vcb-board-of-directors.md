#### VCB Board of Directors

**The Coos Bay-North Bend Visitor & Convention Bureau** (VCB) was created through an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the City of Coos Bay, the City of North Bend, and the Coquille Indian Tribe. A Restatement of the IGA was put into place in 2022, adding Coos County when voters approved the lodging tax in the unincorporated Charleston area. The IGA is the Governing Document of the VCB and a Board of Directors oversees the Policies and Activities of the VCB.

_The VCB’s primary mission is to promote the Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston areas as Oregon’s Adventure Coast to encourage tourism to the area, and, therefore, economic vitality from tourism._

As per the IGA, the Board of Directors of the VCB is made up of one (1) representative from each of the IGA Partners, plus one (1) Chamber of Commerce representative and one (1) Lodging Industry representative. Currently, the VCB Board of Directors are:

* **Lucinda DiNovo**, The Mill Casino and Coquille Indian Tribe Representative, Chair
* **Rodger Craddock**, The City of Coos Bay Representative, Vice Chair
* **Larry Garboden**, The City of North Bend Representative
* **Tim Hyatt,** The Charleston Merchants Association and Coos County Representative
* **Mark Mattecheck**, North Bend Lanes and Chamber Representative,
* **Joseph Monahan**, Best Western Holiday Hotel and Lodging Industry Representative
