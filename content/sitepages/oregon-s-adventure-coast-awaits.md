Oregon’s Adventure Coast is excited to be **THE** Oregon Coast destination for nonstop flights from San Francisco to North Bend, Oregon **(SFO to OTH).** <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Airlines</a> is offering several nonstop flights a week to Oregon's South Coast and the only commercial airport on the Oregon Coast. You may already know our area—or perhaps you’ve heard of us because of the world-renowned [Bandon Dunes Golf Resort](https://bandondunesgolf.com), just down the road. Either way, when you need a new outdoor adventure, you’ve found it.  We feel a strong kinship with our friends in the Bay Area, who share our passion for outdoor adventure, big views, and easy access to nature.

The Southern Oregon Coast offers temperate weather and enough space for every visitor to do what they love, with room to spare.
