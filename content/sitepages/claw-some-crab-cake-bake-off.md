###

### The 2023 Claw-some Crab Cake Bake-Off contest has now closed.&nbsp;

Thank you all for your interest and amazing entries. Please come back later in July, after our judges have had a chance to determine and notify the winners. It's going to be a tough job for our judges because the entries were all so CLAW-SOME!

To keep informed of all that goes on, on the Oregon's Adventure Coast *(and next year's contest details)*, sign up for our monthly newsletter. You can find that sign up form at the top of this page on mobile or at the top of the sidebar on desktop.&nbsp;

Thank you!!
