### **THE 2024 CLAW-SOME CRAB CAKE BAKE-OFF CONTEST HAS NOW CLOSED.**

Thank you all for your interest and amazing entries. Please come back later in July, after our judges have had a chance to determine and notify the winners. It’s going to be a tough job for our judges because the entries were all so CLAW-SOME!

To keep informed of all that goes on, on the Oregon’s Adventure Coast *(and next year’s contest details)*, sign up for our monthly newsletter. You can find that sign up form at the top of this page on mobile or at the top of the sidebar on desktop.

Thank you!!
