## Ocean and Freshwater Fishing in Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston

There are more than [30 freshwater lakes and rivers](/tripideas/fresh-water-fishing-options-by-body-of-water) to choose from in Coos County, as well as fantastic [bay and ocean fishing](/tripideas/saltwater-fishing-ocean-bay) . And just as there are a wide variety of fish and fishing spots, so too are there lots of different ways to fish for them. Looking to paddle your kayak around a quiet fish-filled lake? We’ve got that. Want to cast a line for surfperch right off one of our beautiful beaches? No problem. Throw in a [crab pot](/crabbing-clamming/) or [dig for clams](/clamming/) ? You got it. Thinking [charter boat fishing](/tour-guides-and-charters/) for tuna, rockfish, halibut or salmon? You’ll find that on Oregon’s Adventure Coast too.
