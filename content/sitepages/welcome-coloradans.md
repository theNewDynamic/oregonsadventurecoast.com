Oregon’s Adventure Coast is excited to be **THE** Oregon Coast destination for direct flights from Denver to North Bend, Oregon **(DEN to OTH).** <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Airlines</a> is offering daily non-stop flights from May 22 to October 29, 2025 to Oregon's South Coast and the only commercial airport on the Oregon Coast. So when you think you need a new outdoor adventure, you’ve found it.

The Southern Oregon Coast offers temperate weather and enough space for every visitor to do what they love, with room to spare.
