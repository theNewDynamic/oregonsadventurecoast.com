Thank you for having your gathering here. We know that you need to meet specific logistical items to have a successful event, such as rooms, meeting space, catering, access and support services and to that end, rest assured that Oregon’s Adventure Coast has the ability to host small gatherings, of as few as 10, all the way up to large groups up to 500 people.

But, logistics aside, we also have the ability to work with you, one-on-one, to define needs and find unique and creative venues, as well as provide itineraries for social outings. It is important to us that you have all your details met, but it’s rewarding for us, to know we’ve given you a back drop and venues that event attendees will remember fondly.

If you’d like more personalized help, e-mail us today at [info@oregonsadventurecoast.com](mailto:info@oregonsadventurecoast.com).
