We know you cannot wait to get here, and we cannot wait to host you!  But this has been a wild year, and we ask you to prepare differently for your 2021 visit than you probably have in years past.

**Oregon's Adventure Coast: Coos Bay North Bend & Charleston** has experienced moderate confirmed case numbers and moderate & high risk levels, and we are still not open 100%. For example, some restaurants have remained takeout only. If they are open to indoor dining, there may be restrictions on how many people can be inside at once, or how many people can sit at your table.

**_Please be gracious. Our waitstaff do not have control over this._**

Before you come visit, please have a plan. And also have a backup plan. Ideally, book a place to stay with one of our many [lodging facilities](/lodging/) before you embark on your travels. Staying overnight gives you a place to be, and helps to keep parking and traffic congestion minimized. Pack your patience and kindness along with your hiking boots and fishing gear. It may be a longer wait to check in than it has been in the past.

**_There is Space to Spread Out on Oregon's Adventure Coast._**

Our beaches, hiking & biking trails, kayaking locations, and the dunes are all open and provide visitors with plenty of space to spread out. However, weekends are generally our busiest times and there will be lines to rent an ATV, limited parking at trailheads and congestion at boat launches.

**_Consider a mid-week visit. It is usually less crowded, and you might even catch a price break on lodging._**

Some places you have visited in the past may currently require a reservation. Even with a reservation, you may have to wait outside - six feet apart, and with a mask on - to get inside.

And, it might be raining.

Or, it might be unusually warm. Be prepared either way.

As our restrictions ease, we still remain cautious. We are doing our best to keep everyone safe. All while navigating through ever-changing guidelines.

**_Please remember: We are all in this together. Pack your patience & kindness along with your hiking boots and fishing gear this summer!_**

_May we all be safe, patient, flexible, and kind._
