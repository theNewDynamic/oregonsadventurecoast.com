Accessibility is about far more than checking boxes or meeting minimum ADA standards. On Oregon’s Adventure Coast, it’s a commitment—a promise to open our doors wider so everyone can see, hear, explore, and fully experience the beauty and possibilities this region holds.

### Wheel the World

Oregon has always been a pioneer—and now, thanks to a powerful partnership between [Travel Oregon](https://traveloregon.com/) and [Wheel the World](https://wheeltheworld.com/accessible-travel/usa/oregon/coos-bay), that pioneering spirit has reached a new milestone. Oregon is officially the first state in the U.S. to be designated [“Accessibility Verified”](https://industry.traveloregon.com/programs/accessible-travel/wheel-the-world-program/) by Wheel the World, marking an exciting moment for inclusive travel. Oregon’s Adventure Coast: Coos Bay-North Bend-Charleston, along with a dozen other coastal destinations, is proud to be recognized as a Destination Verified community.

[![Wheel the World Destination Verified community](/img/wheel-the-world-destination-verified-banner.jpg)](https://wheeltheworld.com/accessible-travel/usa/oregon/coos-bay)

This achievement reflects our unwavering belief that everyone who visits Oregon’s Adventure Coast; Coos Bay-North Bend-Charleston, and our surrounding communities—should be able to experience the beauty, wonder, and adventure of this region without barriers.

Being Destination Verified means visitors with disabilities and mobility challenges can now plan their trips using an online resource built with accessibility at its core. Increasing access and inclusivity has long been a guiding priority for Coos Bay–North Bend–Charleston Visitor & Convention Bureau.

### David’s Chair

Thanks to the generosity and collaboration of local partners, **David’s Chair Outdoor Mobility Systems** is now available for visitors to reserve **free of charge**. These rugged, track-based chairs empower individuals to explore terrain that was once out of reach—coastal beaches, state parks, forest trails, and more. Unlike traditional wheelchairs, these all-terrain chairs use durable, tank-style tracks that glide across sand, gravel, and uneven ground.

With support from a recent Travel Oregon grant, a new, even more beach-friendly track chair is now available at the Coos Bay Visitor Center, complete with a tow-and-go trailer for easy transport.

For more details about David's Chair availability contact the Coos Bay–North Bend–Charleston Visitor & Convention Bureau at [info@visitoac.com](mailto:info@visitoac.com). [**Learn more about David's Chair.**](https://davidschair.org/)
