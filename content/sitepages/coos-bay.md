**Coos Bay** was established in the 1850’s as Marshfield, but changed its name to Coos Bay in 1944. Year’s later, the cities’ of Empire and Eastside merged with Coos Bay making Coos Bay the largest city on the Oregon Coast with a current population of 16,292. Coos Bay is also the birthplace of legendary runner, [Steve Prefontaine](/steve-prefontaine-story).

The name Coos Bay is derived from the area’s Indigenous Tribes' word for "South" (Kuukuus or Kuukwis) in the Hanis and Milluk languages. Several Tribes called the Coos Bay region their ancestral homeland including the Coquille Indian Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians. For more information on this topic, [read this great blog](https://shichils.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/place-of-pines-a-case-of-mistaken-identity/?) from Milluk Language expert, Patty Phillips.

Today, you’ll find intriguing restaurants, gourmet coffee houses, antique shops, gift shops, the Coos History Museum, and the Coos Art Museum, the 3rd oldest art museum in Oregon. Thanks to Coos Bay’s progressive vision, you’ll find a rejuvenated and quickly changing downtown area with growing retail and service sectors. The downtown area known as the Old Marshfield district is adjacent to the Coos Bay Boardwalk where locals and visitors alike can often be seen enjoying the waterfront views. New developments along the waterfront and Front Street include a variety of new restaurants and shops.
