![Sports Facilities in the  Coos Bay, North Bend & Charleston Area](/img/sports-blog-post.jpg)

Here in the Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston Area we love Sports. Maybe its because of our ties with legendary track athlete [Steve Prefontaine](/steve-prefontaine-story/), maybe its the small town atmosphere and local support, or maybe its just that we appreciate sportsmanship and competition. We’re home to many first class events including the Prefontaine Memorial Run, OSAA’s 3A Basketball Tournament, Track & Field Master’s Invitational and hopefully your next event.

Let us know what we can do to help. Our facilities, our lodging properties and our community want you here! E-mail us today at [mailto:info@oregonsadventurecoast.com](mailto:info@oregonsadventurecoast.com). And take a look at the [Oregon Sports Planning Guide: Coos Bay/North Bend](https://sportsplanningguide.com/sand-seafood-and-surf-the-escapades-are-boundless-on-oregons-adventure-coast/) for more information on all facilities.
