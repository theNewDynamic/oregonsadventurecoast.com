### Background of the Lights

Holiday Lights at Shore Acres State Park, has been a staple with an average yearly attendance of over 50,000 guests from six continents.

These dazzling lights have illuminated the night each holiday season for decades, every day from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve except for 2020 and 2021 due to COVID. We want to make sure your audience knows this tradition is back, and just as stunning as ever. That’s why we are holding this press day, prior to opening to the public.

Please join us to photograph and video the amazing scenes, and talk with representatives from the Coos Bay, North Bend, Charleston Visitor & Convention Bureau, Friends of Shore Acres, and the park service. Light food and drink will be served.
