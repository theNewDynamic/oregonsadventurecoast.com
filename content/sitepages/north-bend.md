North Bend is named to reflect its geographic location as it is situated on the north bend of the bay. Originally named Yarrow, the community was founded in 1863 by Thomas Symons and later purchased by Louis Simpson in 1902. He merged Yarrow with “Old Town” a mill site owned by his father Asa and renamed the area North Bend in 1903.

Today North Bend is home to 10,218 people and proudly boasts Oregon Coast’s only airport, the <a href="http://flyoth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southwest Oregon Regional Airport</a> (airport code: OTH), Oregon Coast’s largest enclosed shopping mall, <a href="http://ponyvm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pony Village Mall</a>, and the historic McCullough Bridge. You’ll also find Horsfall Beach and the North Spit, named as one of Sunset Magazine’s top ten beach strolls in the western region, and the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, home of the towering 500 foot sand dunes and some of the most amazing ATV and off-roading opportunities to be found.
